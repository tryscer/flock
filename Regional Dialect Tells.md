Here’s a tight batch of 1958 regional tells you can sprinkle into dialogue. I’ll flag who says it naturally (NYC vs. North Carolina/Piedmont South), and why.

- **Queue talk.**  
    NYC teen: “We were **waiting on line** for the coaster.”  
    NC teen: “We were **waiting in line** for the coaster.” (NYC-ism documented; elsewhere it’s “in line.” ([Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/grammar/is-it-on-line-or-in-line?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Do you wait 'on line' or 'in line'?")))
    
- **Second-person plural.**  
    NC teen: “**Y’all** coming?” (ubiquitous Southern plural; attested since the 1800s, widely Southern by mid-20th c.) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%27all?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Y'all"))  
    NYC teen: “**You guys** coming?” (neutral Northern default; contrast helps mark region.)
    
- **About to.**  
    NC teen: “I’m **fixin’ to** go.” (classic Southern future marker; widely observed by linguists.) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_American_English?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Southern American English"))
    
- **Give a ride.**  
    NC teen: “Can you ==**carry** me to the fair?”== (Southern ‘carry’ = ‘give a lift’.) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_American_English?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Southern American English"))
    
- **Push the button.**  
    NC teen: “**Mash** the elevator button.” (well-documented NC turn of phrase.) ([UNC Press Blog](https://uncpressblog.com/2014/08/07/excerpt-talkin-tar-heel-by-walt-wolfram-and-jeffrey-reaser/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Excerpt: Talkin' Tar Heel, by Walt Wolfram and Jeffrey Reaser"))
    
- **Turn the lights off.**  
    NC teen: “**Cut** the light off.” (Southern usage for on/off.) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_American_English?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Southern American English"))
    
- **Soft drinks.**  
    NC teen: “Grab a **Coke**” (meaning any soda; Southern generic).  
    NYC teen: “Grab a **soda**.” (regional naming mapped by the Harvard Dialect Survey.) ([The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/2013/11/soda-vs-pop-vs-coke-mapping-how-americans-talk/465402/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Soda vs. Pop vs. Coke: Mapping How Americans Talk"))
    
- **Sandwich names.**  
    NYC teen: “Let’s split a **hero**.” (NYC term, attested by 1937; distinct from Philly **hoagie** / New England **grinder**.) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine_sandwich?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Submarine sandwich"))
    
- **Coffee order.**  
    NYC teen at a corner luncheonette: “One **regular**.” (means coffee with milk and sugar in NYC parlance.) ([City Lore](https://citylore.org/taste-buttered-roll-and-regular-coffee/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "TASTE: Buttered roll and regular coffee"))
    
- **Corner shop culture.**  
    NYC teen: “Meet me at the **luncheonette**; I’ll get an **egg cream**.” (quintessential NYC soda-fountain drink; 1950s candy-store staple.) ([Lexington Candy Shop](https://www.lexingtoncandyshop.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Lexington Candy Shop | NYC Luncheonette"))
    
- **Transit texture (for a NYC cousin scene).**  
    “Got a **token**? It’s **15 cents** now.” (tokens introduced July 25, 1953, fare 15¢ through ’66.) ([New-York Historical Society](https://www.nyhistory.org/blogs/remember-the-nyc-subway-token?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Remember The NYC Subway Token"))  
    Pay phones: “Got a dime?” (local calls were typically **10¢** by the ’50s.) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payphone?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Payphone"))
    

Tiny, era-true extras you can lace in:

- NC food talk: “pimento cheese,” “barbecue” meaning **pork** by default (Carolina sense). Pair with “y’all” and “fixin’ to” for instant Piedmont. (Use alongside the Southern items above. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_American_English?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Southern American English")))
    
- NYC scene-setters: “stoop,” “the **subway**,” “uptown/downtown,” and a kid bragging he downed two **egg creams** at a **luncheonette** counter. (See luncheonette/egg-cream sources.) ([Lexington Candy Shop](https://www.lexingtoncandyshop.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Lexington Candy Shop | NYC Luncheonette"))
