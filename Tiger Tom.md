# “Tiger Tom” (John T. Mitchell) — quotes & voice

## Documented quotes (from late-life interviews)

- “I wrote stories about people who wanted to do things for all people… That’s what America is about.” ([CBS 6 News Richmond WTVR](https://www.wtvr.com/2016/10/27/richmond-newsman-tiger-tom-mitchell-still-roars-as-he-turns-100 "Richmond newsman ‘Tiger Tom’ Mitchell still roars as he turns 100"))
    
- “The country’s not safe… because people prefer power over niceness.” ([CBS 6 News Richmond WTVR](https://www.wtvr.com/2016/10/27/richmond-newsman-tiger-tom-mitchell-still-roars-as-he-turns-100 "Richmond newsman ‘Tiger Tom’ Mitchell still roars as he turns 100"))
    
- “Old Tom Mitchell… believes in America. America is simple: Everybody is free. Everybody!” ([CBS 6 News Richmond WTVR](https://www.wtvr.com/2016/10/27/richmond-newsman-tiger-tom-mitchell-still-roars-as-he-turns-100 "Richmond newsman ‘Tiger Tom’ Mitchell still roars as he turns 100"))
    

## What his on-air style sounded like (and why)

- **Boisterous, clear, community-first.** He literally earned the nickname “Tiger Tom” for a _boisterous broadcast style_; WANT-AM was his home base. ([Richmond Free Press](https://richmondfreepress.com/news/2017/jul/14/broadcast-legend-tiger-tom-mitchell-dies/ "Broadcast legend ‘Tiger Tom’ Mitchell dies |  Richmond Free Press | Serving the African American Community in Richmond, VA"))
    
- **Fast, extemporaneous newscasts.** Colleagues recalled he could open the mic and deliver a tight **five-minute** news + weather hit **with no script**. That implies measured cadence, short declaratives, and clean segues. ([CBS 6 News Richmond WTVR](https://www.wtvr.com/2016/10/27/richmond-newsman-tiger-tom-mitchell-still-roars-as-he-turns-100 "Richmond newsman ‘Tiger Tom’ Mitchell still roars as he turns 100"))
    
- **Gospel/obits/news blend.** At WANT-990 he spun gospel records, read community news and **remembrances of the dead**—a preacher-meets-newsman tone rather than hard “jive” nonstop. ([Richmond Free Press](https://richmondfreepress.com/news/2017/jul/14/broadcast-legend-tiger-tom-mitchell-dies/ "Broadcast legend ‘Tiger Tom’ Mitchell dies |  Richmond Free Press | Serving the African American Community in Richmond, VA"))
    
- **Local pride, Black-owned identity.** He loved noting WANT’s call-letters as “**With All Negro Talent**,” anchoring his show in Richmond’s Black institutions.

- **Active in 1958.** Contemporary photo places him on the air that year (useful for your summer-’58 setting).

### Context from Black-appeal radio (for texture)

Richmond jocks didn’t always rhyme like Philly/NY stars, but the **toolkit** was shared: rhymed intros/outros, signifying, alliteration, and call-and-response. See Dr. Hepcat’s printed “jive” (KVET, 1948), Daddy-O Daylie’s rhyming patter, and Jocko Henderson’s rhythmic breaks. Use sparingly for Tiger Tom—his peers remember him as emphatic and uplifting, more civic than shtick.

## Period-correct mic-breaks you can borrow (original pastiche)

Not real quotes—these are era-true lines you can safely put in his mouth on WANT-990 in ’58:

- “Richmond, good afternoon—this is **Tiger Tom on WANT**, with the sunshine sound and the straight news, so lean in and let’s begin.”
    
- “Mamas and daddies, sisters and friends—hold that dial. After the weather we got a hand-clapper to lift your load.”
    
- “To the dearly departed, we remember you; to the living, keep loving one another. Now let that record roll.”
    
- “Armstrong, Walker, Maggie L., Jackson Ward—I see you. Let’s be good to each other and enjoy this next gospel shout.”
    

## Quick writer’s checklist for his voice

Short declaratives; warm preacherly cadence; **community roll-calls**; brief moral maxims; crisp news-to-music hand-offs; a touch of alliteration; sponsor tags local to Jackson Ward/Petersburg; and a steady, encouraging tone.

### Bonus crumbs you can weave in

- He read **obituaries** on air (“remembrances”), which can anchor scene transitions. ([Richmond Free Press](https://richmondfreepress.com/news/2017/jul/14/broadcast-legend-tiger-tom-mitchell-dies/ "Broadcast legend ‘Tiger Tom’ Mitchell dies |  Richmond Free Press | Serving the African American Community in Richmond, VA"))
    
- He covered and announced the **Armstrong–Walker Classic**—great for local shout-outs in patter. ([m.richmondfreepress.com](https://m.richmondfreepress.com/news/2016/oct/28/tiger-tom-hits-100/ "‘Tiger Tom’ hits 100  |  Richmond Free Press | Serving the African American Community in Richmond, VA"))
    
- A doc on Richmond/Petersburg soul-radio pioneers (“I Know You Got Soul”) helps set the dial-culture vibe. ([styleweekly.com](https://www.styleweekly.com/i-know-you-got-soul/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "I Know You Got Soul"))
    

_Note:_ I couldn’t locate surviving **airchecks** of Mitchell’s 1950s shows to quote verbatim. What we do have are solid contemporaneous accounts of his **boisterous yet dignified** style, plus exemplars of 1950s Black DJ patter to calibrate rhythm and diction. If you turn up any WANT-990 recordings, I’ll dissect his timing, pitch, and phrasing in detail.
