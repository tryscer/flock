### **Ahmet Ertegun: From Turkish Diplomat’s Son to R&B Kingpin (Up to 1958)**

#### **1. Early Life and the Jazz Obsession (1923 – 1946)**

Ahmet Ertegun was born in Istanbul in 1923, the son of Turkey's ambassador to the United States. His childhood was spent moving between embassies in Switzerland, France, the UK, and eventually Washington D.C., giving him an unusually global perspective.

Crucially, while his family lived in luxury and high society, Ahmet and his older brother Nesuhi became obsessed with American music—specifically jazz and blues—which they encountered through records and by frequenting segregated nightclubs in Washington D.C. and Harlem. This immersion gave them a rare and genuine appreciation for "race music" that the established, major record companies (like Columbia and RCA Victor) largely ignored or relegated to white cover artists.

#### **2. The Founding of Atlantic Records (1947)**

By the time his father died in 1944, Ahmet was studying medieval philosophy at Georgetown University, but his passion was the music business.

- **Motivation:** Ertegun and his partner, Herb Abramson (a dental student and A&R man), decided to start a record label not just to make money, but to make the records they genuinely loved and believed in.
    
- **Financing:** In October 1947, Atlantic Records was founded in New York City with a modest **$10,000 loan from the Ertegun family dentist, Dr. Vahdi Sabit.**
    
- **Initial Focus:** The label was conceived primarily as an independent outlet for modern jazz and Rhythm & Blues (R&B).
    

#### **3. Establishing the "House That Ruth Built" (1948 – 1952)**

Atlantic quickly distinguished itself from the older, more corporate Majors through a hands-on, artist-first approach.

- **First Hits:** Atlantic’s first major success came with the signing of **Ruth Brown** in 1949. Her powerful, soulful R&B hits like "Teardrops from My Eyes" (1950) became Atlantic’s first million-selling record. Brown's consistency in topping the R&B charts made her the label's biggest artist for years, earning Atlantic the nickname **"The House That Ruth Built."**
    
- **Songwriting:** Ertegun became a songwriter himself out of necessity, creating classic blues and R&B songs like Big Joe Turner's "Chains of Love" and Ray Charles's "Mess Around" under the pseudonym **"A. Nugetre"** (Ertegun spelled backward) to save money on publishing fees.
    
- **Creative Philosophy:** Unlike Majors who focused on stiff arrangements, Ertegun and Abramson fostered a family atmosphere and allowed their artists creative freedom, developing the **"Atlantic Sound"**—a highly rhythmic, boogie-based R&B style.
    

#### **4. The Soul Revolution and Technological Edge (1953 – 1958)**

The mid-1950s saw Atlantic solidify its status as the premier independent label and a true force for musical change.

- **Jerry Wexler Joins (1953):** When Herb Abramson was drafted into the Army, Ertegun hired **Jerry Wexler**, a _Billboard_ writer who had coined the term "Rhythm & Blues." Wexler became a partner and producer, intensifying Atlantic's focus on Black popular music and enhancing the label's studio professionalism.
    
- **Ray Charles:** In 1952, Atlantic bought Ray Charles's contract from a folding label for $2,500. Under Ertegun and Wexler’s guidance, Charles blended gospel with blues, creating the foundational sound of **soul music** with hits like "I Got a Woman" (1954). This era with Atlantic is considered the birth of soul and profoundly influenced all future popular music.
    
- **Innovation:** Ertegun championed engineer **Tom Dowd**, making Atlantic one of the first independent labels to record in high-quality stereo and adopt multi-track recording systems (the first label to use an 8-track machine was 1957), giving their R&B and rock records a superior, richer sound than the mono releases of many competitors.
    
- **Embracing Rock:** While Ertegun famously missed out on signing Elvis Presley in 1955, Atlantic adapted by launching the subsidiary **ATCO Records** in 1955. ATCO was designed to capture the growing pop and rock market, soon signing acts like **The Coasters** and, critically, **Bobby Darin** in 1958. Darin's immediate success with hits like "Splish Splash" ensured that by the close of 1958, Atlantic was ready to fully compete in the rock and roll era.
    

By 1958, Ertegun had successfully positioned Atlantic Records as the authentic alternative to the Major labels. They were responsible for the best R&B, were technologically ahead of the curve, and were just beginning to successfully cross over into the exploding white youth market that would soon dominate the American charts.


### Atlantic Records Shady practices
Atlantic Records, for all its creative integrity and dedication to R&B, was a business operating within a morally corrupt industry structure. While Ahmet Ertegun and Jerry Wexler prided themselves on being artist-friendly and technologically innovative compared to the conservative Majors, they were absolutely involved in practices that exploited artists, particularly concerning royalties and the Payola system.

Here is an expansion on Atlantic's business practices up to 1958:

### **Atlantic Records: The Shady Side of the "House That Ruth Built"**

Atlantic Records' history up to 1958 is marked by a deep contradiction: they were pioneers of R&B and soul, fostering incredible talent like Ray Charles, but their business model often resembled the exploitative system used by other labels.

#### **1. The Royalty Scams and Ruth Brown's Case**

The most significant evidence of exploitative practices centers on the payment structure for their R&B artists, especially in the label's formative years.

- **Underpayment:** Atlantic was known as "The House That Ruth Built" because **Ruth Brown** was their biggest-selling artist in the early 1950s.1 Despite multiple number-one R&B hits, Brown famously claimed she **never received any meaningful royalty payments** during her tenure.
    
- **The Debt System:** Like many independent labels, Atlantic used contracts that charged artists for virtually every cost associated with the record—studio time, touring expenses, even packaging and artwork—which were recouped _before_ any royalties were paid.2 This system created a perpetual state of "debt" for the artist. When Brown left the label in 1961, Atlantic claimed _she owed them_ money.3
    
- **The Aftermath:** It took until the late 1980s, after a long legal fight, for Brown and other aging R&B artists to receive compensation. Ahmet Ertegun, recognizing the historical wrong, made a large voluntary payment and became a key figure in establishing the **Rhythm and Blues Foundation** to help other victimized artists.4 While Atlantic later prided itself on being fairer than the Majors, the reality for their biggest R&B stars in the 50s was financial exploitation.
    

#### **2. Payola Participation**

While the name "Atlantic" wasn't as central to the 1959 Payola hearings as individual DJs like Alan Freed, the label absolutely participated in the practice to secure airplay.

- **Necessity in the Nineties:** In the segregated 1950s, Payola—bribing disc jockeys to play a record—was less an exception and more a **necessary cost of doing business**, especially for independent labels trying to break into the white-dominated Top 40 market.
    
- **The Pluggers:** Atlantic and its partners worked with independent promoters and record pluggers who were known to give cash and gifts to DJs. While Ertegun and Wexler may not have personally handed over envelopes of cash, they employed the system to ensure their records (like those by The Drifters and Ray Charles) were played, bypassing racist programming constraints.
    
- **Chart Manipulation:** Payola and promotional cash were crucial to forcing R&B records onto pop radio playlists and jukeboxes, manufacturing hits and challenging the dominance of the Major labels. Atlantic utilized this system to elevate their artists from regional R&B hits to national Pop sensations.
    

#### **3. The "Cover" Dilemma (Exploitation by Proxy)**

Atlantic's business model was also indirectly enabled by the racist practices of the larger industry: the practice of white artists covering Black artists' songs.

- **The Risk:** When Atlantic scored a major R&B hit, like Big Joe Turner's original **"Shake, Rattle and Roll"** (1954), Major labels immediately recorded sanitized cover versions with white singers like Bill Haley. These covers often stole the pop market share because they had access to wider distribution and non-segregated radio.
    
- **Atlantic's Response:** Instead of folding, Atlantic doubled down on producing _superior_ recordings with their original artists, and used the commercial success of the cover versions as proof of concept that R&B had massive crossover potential. They understood that the white covers ultimately paved the way for their own Black artists, such as Ray Charles, to eventually break through nationally without being covered.
    

In summary, Ahmet Ertegun's Atlantic was a technologically and artistically progressive force in the 1950s that genuinely valued the music it sold. However, like every other successful label in that fiercely competitive and corrupt era, Atlantic engaged in the transactional, exploitative business practices (especially concerning artist royalties and Payola) required to survive and thrive against the powerful Major corporations.
