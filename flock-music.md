# Side 1: Alice
## Track 1: Alice Gets in a Car

*DJ Jonah here, coming to you LIVE on the air from a SECRET LOCATION up in the BIRD'S NEST, overlooking a beautiful valley which shall NOT BE NAMED… and let me tell you, listener JANE and listener JOHN… let me tell you… it's overrun with birds today, big ones, small ones, green ones and white ones, flocking together, going their own way, this way and then the other… Did you know the ancient ROMANS, Caesar himself, would read the future by the flight of the birds? Anyway, here's The CHORDETTES with LOLLIPOP…*

*Ba-Boom Boom-Boom*…  
​	It's an early-summer morning and the windows in my childhood bedroom are open, inviting smells of fresh cut grass and fat, lazy bumblebees. I’m wearing a baby-blue, sleeveless cotton sundress and white Keds. A record is playing on the little turntable I got for my birthday. I’m dancing with myself, twirling and bowing to an invisible suitor — keeping one eye on my bedroom door, lest it should suddenly open.

*(Gee, my lollipop is—HHHWWWONK\!)*

I peer through the window overlooking the street and Cindy's brother's Chevy, red with white top and sides, is parked beside our lawn.  
​	"Be quiet\!" I say, laughing, waving my hands at them to pipe down. I lift the needle from the little record,

*(Lolli-SCRATCH\!)*

and stuff some necessities into my handbag: a little powder kit, my babysitting fortune of $17.62, and, after giving it some thought, a change of cream-colored panties.  
​	"We'll all be late, Peaches\!" yells Cindy from the car. I shoo at her and climb down the old Elm tree planted beneath my bedroom window.  
​	I run across my parents' front lawn, stealthy and undetected. I slip into the back seat.   
Inside it's full of people and already steaming hot. Ricky Nelson is singing on the radio about having been a little fool. Cindy is stunning in a coral dress in the back seat, blonde and blue-eyed and radiating sunshine. I hug her and she says quietly, "I've got something to–"  
​	"Peaches\!"  
"Don't call me that," I say to Barry, who’s sweating at the wheel in a brown suit that looks too big for him.   
 ​	"Who's she?" says the girl sitting next to Cindy without looking in my direction. She’s got black cigarette pants and a black turtleneck and black sunglasses and black flat shoes. She’s reading through *Seventeen* (“The Big FASHION Issue\!”.)   
​	"Oh," says Cindy, storing her secret. "I want you to meet my favorite cousin.” Her voice, warm and loud and Southern, takes on its Party-Hostess quality.   
​	"Eleanore," says the cousin over the magazine. Cindy lays a hand on her knee and says, "After we’re done, we're taking Eleanore back to the train station going home. She lives in *New-York-City*, you know". Eleanore winces.  
​	"We've met before," I tell Eleanore.  
​	"Have we?" she says, disinterested. She pushes Cindy's hand away without looking up.  
​	"Alright boys and girls, here we go," says Barry. We jerk in our seats as the old jalopy springs into action. 

Sitting shotgun is a mystery boy, tall, very handsome, ginger-haired. He’s wearing a tight, white tee-shirt and has his hand resting limply around Barry’s back. I give Cindy an important look and signal at him.   
​	"Oh," says Cindy, her voice resuming that Party Hostess quality, "this of course is Barry's friend Tim". She whispers in my ear, "he has *all* the records". To Tim she says, "please meet Peaches. She’s a music fan, too".  
​	"Don't call me that," I whisper to her.  
​	“Sorry,” she whispers back.   
​	"It's, eh, it's nice to meet you," I say to Tim.  
"So what's your real name, then?" he says. From his seat, right in front of me, he can only look at me through the rearview mirror. In the little frame I see his shades sitting atop his beautiful nose. He has a deep voice, deeper than Barry's, and he's wearing a very tight tee-shirt.  
"It's, ah," I say, gracefully, "it's Peggy Sue".  
Cindy and Barry snort with laughter. "Tell him your real name, Peaches," says Cindy.  
​	"It's Allison," I whisper.  
​	"What? Alice?" says Tim, already looking away. It seems Cindy's betrayal has cost me what little attention he had for me.  
​	"Yeah, I guess," I mumble. "Alice would do".  
​	"My little Wonderland girl," Cindy laughs, holding my hand. I instantly forgive her. "Here's to Alice\!"  
Barry and Tim and Eleanore join in a choir: "Alice\!"  
We all laugh. Somebody turns up the volume…

*(Splish splash\! I was having a bath\!)*

Scenic Greensboro rolls across the windows: the trimmed green lawns and rustic red stone of College Park. "Now, Alice, I'm responsible for you," says Barry. If you listened to them, you couldn’t tell Cindy and Barry are siblings: Cindy kept her Alabama accent, but Barry lost his for a moderately adequate impression of a bigger-city, North Carolina speech. "I assume you told your parents you would be riding with me?"  
​	"Of course," I lie. "Mamma sends her regards".  
​	“Much obliged. Now, there might be some rough customers at the Fair today, so you girls stick close to me and Tim,” he says. I’m thinking, “Boy, does he like to say 'Now' with such gravitas.”  
​	"Oh," says Barry. "And, now, no talking to strangers".

"Alice has never been to a live show before," says our hostess. "This is going to be her first one".  
​	"Aha," I say, "my very first show".  
​	"A greenhorn,” says Eleanore dryly. "Well, you know, I myself have been to *dozens* of shows. And Cindy, you've been to a handful yourself, right?"  
​	I wonder at the reason for the obvious slight and quickly find him in the front seat, peering at the map from atop his shades. The sweat on his neck glistens in the late morning sun.  
​	Cindy presses against me. I look to my left: Eleanore and Cindy are sitting a foot apart. Both are locking sights on Tim. It suddenly feels even hotter in the car. "Tim, didn’t you say," says Cindy, “it's not the number of shows, it's how *gas* the numbers are. Isn't that right, Tim?”  
"That's right, kidd-o”, says Tim, without looking up from his map.   
​	Cindy ventures, "Is the show we're going to… in your opinion, of course…"  
​	"Well," says Tim, and looks back at Cindy. This favor does not go unnoticed with Cindy. "well, kidd-o… this will be the show of your young life. Years from now, when you're… like… forty or something… you'll tell your grandkids all about that show you saw today". The sun going through the strands of his orange hair seems to fill me with pleasant tingles.  
​	"What's their name, pretty?" I say. I realize what it is I said when everybody, Barry included, turns to look at me. "What's their pretty name I mean. I mean I bet their name is real pretty". I sink into my seat and add: "Um".  
Barry and Tim exchange disgusted, amused looks. To my horror, Cindy and Eleanore do the same. It seems my catastrophe has reunited them… if only for a moment. The next one, Eleanore is saying, “So, Tim, have you been to any of their shows?”  
​	“Who?” I venture. “Who are they?”  
​	“I have both of their singles,” Tim says.   
​	“So you’ve never seen them live. Tsk, tsk.”   
​	Tim seems confused by Eleanore’s probing. “I did listen to them very seriously,” he says.   
​	“To whom?” I say.  
​	Eleanore says, “you know, it’s really not the same thing… Listening to them on your little record player, and feeling the music in your *bare bones*.”  
​	“Music is music, *Eleanore*,” says Tim, hurt.  
​	“Who’s music? Who?” I repeat. Eleanore sighs and shoves a torn piece of newspaper in my face: "The Seven-Tops.”  
​	“They're from *Nashville*,” adds Tim, sounding professional.  
​	The newspaper lists the many ACTS and SHOWS and POINTS OF INTEREST in this year's HENRICO COUNTY FAIR at VIRGINIA’S STRAWBERRY HILL FAIRGROUNDS \- ACHIEVEMENT DAY\! — among them, and circled in red, are the SEVEN-TOPS, to be playing at 2:30 p.m., right after THE PILLAR OF STEAM. I imagine a train engine, a huge cloud emanating from its chimney, and a bunch of Israelites following, standing on the roofs of the cars, and I giggle.  
​	"What's Achievement Day?" I ask.  
​	"Now, this is the day set apart for Black businessmen, performers and fairgoers," says Barry from behind the wheel. ​	"It is, also, the reason we're driving there today.”  
​	“Officially,” Cindy says and winks at me.   
​	"Black performers?" I whisper. I feel so rebellious and free that I have half a mind to pull Tim's face to mine and see if he kisses me.  
​	"That's right, Barry's got a real important job to do," says Cindy. "Father sent him on a top-secret mission\!"  
​	"Quiet, sister", says Barry, not looking too hurt. “It’s actually *my* mission.”  
​	"What's your secret mission, Barry?" asks Tim.  
​	"He needs to personally inspect every cigarette in the fair\!"  
​	“You talk to me like that," says Barry, "when you have a job. And I'm inspecting the cigarette *girls*. For Father's company. It's my own initiative–"  
​	"Really, Barry?" says Eleanore. "You're to personally inspect each cigarette girl?"  
​	"Not you, too\!"  
​	The car is loud with howling and laughter.

*(get your kicks… on route… sixty–)*

"So, um, Tim," I say. "Cindy says you have all the records". ​	
​	“Huh?” Tim says. “Yeah, I guess I do, kidd-o. Bear, what’s that noise?”  
​	“It always sounds like that,” says Barry.   
“Because, you know, I’m quite an avid music fan myself—“  
“What you do,” says Tim, obviously not to me, “is every month, you take apart the carburetor, right? And then you take out all the spark plugs and you arrange them on, like, a blanket. And take some wire brush and some Gunk fluid, right? And you scrub them until they all shine and you are all dirty. Then your engine stops sounding like grandma when she’s got a cold. Because if your engine runs so rough you’re gonna stall, you hear.”   
​	“How dirty do I need to get for this to work?” asks Barry. I give up on my courting attempts.   
​	Cindy sees an opening…  
​	“Tim looks to me like he can fix any engine,” she says and gives him a smile. Tim smiles back — Eleanore is perturbed — but Barry runs a blocking pass:  
​	“You want me to take my engine apart every month?”  
​	“Nah, man, no. You only need to do that every *six* months”.

We're passing the sign saying we are leaving beautiful Greensboro, NC, population of 79,000, and another, advocating the smoking of Buzz Cigarettes (“A Real HONEY of a Smoke\!”). Elvis comes on the radio, his presence announced by an overwhelming procession of staccato guitar riffs.

*(y-y-ouaaain't nothing but a hound…dog)*

"Because," says Cindy, picking up a thread of conversation long forgotten by everyone else, "*I've* seen Elvis".  
Tim turns to her faster than Barry could do doughnuts in the Greensboro Coliseum parking drive.  
​	“Ah-huh”, says Cindy.    
​	“​​​​Is that *right*?” says Tim.   
​	“That’s right. While I was visiting Eleanore in *New York City* last fall.”   
​	“Because,” says Tim, excited now. “You know, Elvis is the King, he’s the *end*\! He’s a real gone cat\! I mean–”  
Puppy slinks back, trying to merge with the car door. Cindy winks at me. Game, set and match. 

Way ahead, in front, Barry and Tim are back arguing over the roadmap. In the relative privacy the argument affords, Cindy turns to me.  
​	"Hey listen", she says. "Listen, I need to –"  
​	"Here's a little tip for the music show neophyte," says Eleanore, trying to gain some face. Cindy abandons her secret again. "What you do,” says Eleanore, “is you bring an extra pair of panties along with you. This way you can throw'em on stage and still be comfortable on your way home".  
​	"Why would you throw your panties at anyone?" I ask, disgusted.  
​	"It's just what you do," insists Eleanore.  
​	"Every time?" I ask.  
​	"Not every time, no," says Eleanore, exasperated. "You save it for special occasions.”  
​	"Like what?"  
​	"Like," says Eleanore, and her face takes on a dreamy quality, "if they sing a song that makes you feel…" she wanders off.  
​	"Feel what?"  
​	"It's when you feel, like, tingles in your panties", adds Cindy.  
​	I'm horrified: like ants in my pants?  
​	"I threw'em once," Cindy says. "At Elvis.”  
​	"Did you hit him?" I ask. We giggle.  
​	"I hit some other dude," says Cindy. "One of the players. Landed on his head. Elvis asked me if I wasn't too cold.”

The radio is blaring. "What did you want to tell me?" I say in Cindy's ear.  

*\(well-she-goan-sendout-aworldwide HOO-do broOM BROOM BROOM)*  

"What?" says Cindy. The noise from the engine is unbrearable.  

*(that'll-be-the-VE..ree thing that BROOM BROOM BROOM BROOM BROOM BROOM–)*  
​
“See? What did I tell you?” Says Tim.   
​	Cindy leans closer to me, grabbing my hand.  

*(BROOM BROOM BROOM\! BROOM BROOM BROOM\!)*  

"Yeah," says Barry. "We'll all be better off finding a place to–"  
​	Cindy whispers in my ear, "I'm running away from home".

For the last two miles Barry and Tim had to push the car, with elder girl Eleanore sitting at the wheel, and all of them engaged in a half-angry shouting match.  
​	"You'll push us into the ditch\!" Eleanore yells. "Tim, put your back into it\! Barry is pushing twice as hard as you\!"  
​	"Will you shut your little mouth and steer the car?"  
And so on.

Cindy and I are sitting in the back seat, holding hands.  
​	"Why would you leave me?" I whisper.  
​	"I'm not… I'm not leaving you".  
​	"You are".  
​	“Yeah, but it's not… it's not you I'm leaving… I have to–"  
​	"Tim, you lazy boy\! Start shoving\!"  
​	"Shut up, little girl\!"  
​	"I have to… you know, I need to–"  
​	"Thank God almighty, there's a service station up ahead\!"  
And so on.

When we reach the Shell Durham Service Station (LARRY'S JUKE JOINT ADJACENT\!) it's so hot even the tarmac is sweating. We can see a couple of peeling pumps, previously red; the workshop behind the office, where a carcass of a car lays hopelessly dead.  
​	Both Barry and Tim are drenched with sweat. Barry took off his coat and tie and he’s leaning on Tim, breathing hard; to our communal delight, Tim has taken off his shirt and is using it to dry his face. We girls leave the car – to get fresh air, of course.  
​	"Fill 'er up?" says the stocky man in overalls who appeared as if out of nowhere. His name patch says his name is Max.  
​	“Nothing much to fill up,” Barry says, “unless you got a mechanic.”  
​	"I can fix her," says Tim.  
​	"Hell you can," says Barry.  
​	Tim says, "they have a little garage over there, with tools and everything–"  
​	"The mechanic's sort of in," says the man whose name is Max.  
​	"That's great\!" says Barry. "Where can we find him? Wait, what do you mean *sorta*?"  
​	"Well," says the man in overalls and scratches his head, "he's in the Juke Joint". He gestures towards a shack further down the road, its entrance marked with crates of empty beer bottles.  
​	"Do you need supervision fixing the car?" Eleanore says to Tim. She is watching him putting on his shirt.  
​	"Come, sister,” says Barry. “Let’s find us a mechanic”. ​	Cindy takes my hand, so I come, too. 

Larry's Juke Joint is a shack not far from, but certainly not adjacent to, the gas station. We walk through a swinging door and inside it’s one small room, cool and dark, smelling of stale beer and tobacco smoke. The sawdust on the floor is trampled and black, a sign that at other times the place is packed with dancers and drinkers. Now, in the morning, it’s empty save for a few dirty tables and an old jukebox. The jukebox is loudly playing a record I know — "Wake Up, Little Susie", by the Everly Brothers. Next to the jukebox, at the only full table, two men sit next to two glasses and a half-empty bottle.  
​	"Please, no more," says the older one. He looks at his glass, nauseated.  
​	"What’s the matter with you?" says the younger man. "I thought you said you could drink". He's got a foreign accent and he's wearing a mechanic's overalls. The embroidered patch on his chest says his name is Eddie.  
We come closer.  
​	"Excuse me," says Barry, official-like. The man whose name is probably Eddie looks up. He's got black eyes and black hair, combed up like a wall above his head, and a clean shaven face. He's striking: not handsome, rather sharp-featured, keen.  
​	"If you're looking for Larry, you gotta holler through the kitchen door," he says. "He's in there making his terrible barbecue".  
​	"Actually," says Barry, "we need a mechanic".  
​	"Tough luck. He's not in today".  
​	"You're wearing a mechanic's uniform," says an indigent Barry and tugs at his tie. I giggle and Cindy presses my hand hard.   
​	"Just keeping his shirt warm. Come on," he says to the sallow-looking fellow next to him, "one last round. I'll give you triple or nothing".  
​	"No more, Eddie," says the sallow man. "Please, no more". He looks at his glass again – it's about one eighth full – and burps thoughtfully.  
​	"Excuse me very much," says Barry. "We have a vehicle in urgent need of repair".  
​	"Oh," says the mechanic. "I didn't know it was a *vehicle*. I thought you just had *car trouble*. In that case, I am *forlorn* to inform you that this very Thursday happens to be the National Day of Appreciation For the Italian-American Partnership, and *in light* of that, and the fact that Max just told me that I'm a slob, and at that a lazy one, our *vehicle repair services* are shut down for the day.”   
​	The other man laughs – a drunkard's laugh, interrupted by belches. He then proceeds to crash head-first into the table. Moments later he's snoring.   
​	Barry looks confused. "Eddie," he says at last. "Can I call you Eddie?"  
​	"Don't know an Eddie," says the mechanic.  
​	"This guy just called you Eddie\!"  
​	"That *drunk*?"  
​	"The hell with you, man. We'll fix our *car* ourselves. Come, girls".  
​	Cindy pulls at my hand. I take a deep breath. I say, "Please, mister. We've got an important errand to run.”  
Eddie's dark eyes turn to me. His attention is intense, not entirely unpleasant.  
​	"What's your important errand, young lady?"  
​	"Well," I say, shifting my weight from leg to leg, "we've got to go see my very first live music show.”  
Barry looks at me like he would look at an infantile, but the mechanic is mollified.  
​	"Oh," he says softly. "I didn't know you guys were music fans.”  
​	"So will you fix our car?"  
"Well…" says Eddie. "I'll fix your car. If, and only if, you play our little game here. As you can see, my play partner" – he slaps the back of the poor fellow lying on the table – "is temporarily indisposed".  
​	"We have no interest in playing your games," says Barry.  ​	"I'll play your game," I say. Barry nudges me.  
​	"Good," says the mechanic. "Good". He gets up nimbly and goes towards that jukebox.

*(...our friends when they-say… oooooooh la la\!)*

"Now this here jukebox," says the mechanic and slaps the old thing, "has a unique, one-of-a-kind behavior. It seems that when you kick it…" he kicks the jukebox like it was a bad dog. Life drains out of it. Its lights dim, the music slows then stops…

*(we gotta go hooooomm–)*

…then, after a moment, it wakes up again, its lights slowly going bright:

*(mmmmmwe– gotta go home…)*

"So this is my game: I'll play you the first two bars of a song of my choosing. Then I'll kick the jukebox. If you guess the song correctly by the time that *machina* remembers who and where it is, I'll take a drink, and then attend to your vehicle. For free.”  
​	"What if I guess wrong?" I ask.  
​	"Then you, my dear, take a drink, and we live to play another round.”  
​	"Absolutely not," says Barry.  
​	"Come on\!" I say to him, "I can win this\!"  
​	"Now, young lady," says Barry. "I promised your mother I'll look after you. No way am I letting a minor drink".  
​	"You're only three years older than us,” says Cindy. “*old man*.”  
​	"Excuse me," says the mechanic. "Are you, sir, a minor?"  ​	Barry straightens his back. "If you must know, I'm almost twenty-one years old.”  
​	"So you do the drinking.”  
​	”Yeah,” says Cindy. “That makes sense\!”  
​	Barry looks even more confused. Cindy and I look at each other.   
​	"Well," says the mechanic. "Pull out a chair.”  
We do.  
​	"Of course," says the mechanic, "I would require some coinage, as my play partner ran through his when he failed to recognize Les Paul and Mary Ford's *How High The Moon*."  
"Give him some coins", I say to Barry. "I could have guessed that in a heartbeat\!"  
​	“That’s a bad idea," says Barry.  
​	"Come on\!" says Cindy. She’s excited, too.   
​	Barry sighs and drops some dimes on the table. The mechanic hunches down and scoops them up with a gambler's trained hand.  
​	"Rrrrrrrr-ound one\!" he exclaims in his sing-song, foreign voice. He turns and fiddles with the jukebox. Then three fast drumbeats emanate from the jukebox. Then four electrifying, winding plucks on an electrified guitar… the mechanic turns to us, smiles and gives the jukebox a backward kick.  
​	Everybody looks at me. Even the drunkard on the table has got one eye half open.  
​	"That's easy," I say. "Roll Over Beethoven. By Chuck Berry. Now fix my friend's car please".  
​	"Not so fast, Susie Q,” says the mechanic. My heart sinks. "You are correct in identifying the genius guitar-slinger involved, but got the song all wrong.”  
​	The jukebox, as if to mock me, springs back to action, proving me wrong.   

*(aaaaah-wn-in-Louisiana close to New Orleans\!)*  
​	
"I told you," says Barry. The drunkard goes back to sleep next to his glass. The mechanic pushes the glass towards Barry and gleefully tilts the bottle over it. Barry looks at his glass, then at the passed-out man next to him. He downs it and winces.  
​	“Don’t worry, you’ll get the next one,” says Cindy. She holds my hand. I look at Barry, feeling guilty.    
​	“Next song,” says the mechanic and turns around. Intertwining, clean notes, like a Spanish guitar being played on an electric, fill the air.   
​	“That’s harder,” I say. The mechanic kicks the jukebox. ​	Cindy squeezes my hand. Barry looks up at me.   
​	“Tick tock,” says the mechanic. I notice that his cup is full — I guess he never drank from it.   
​	“Eh… I mean…”  
​	“Peaches\!” Barry yells. This is getting exciting.   
​	“Oh… Oh shoot…” I say and stomp my foot under the table. ​	“Okay\! Okay\! The name of the artist is Buddy Holly and the name of the song is That’ll Be the Day\! Ha\!”  
The mechanic stares at me, motionless.   
​	“Ooh,” he says as the jukebox winds back to life, sputtering a slew of drumbeats. “So close”. Barry and Cindy shout a collective “no\!”

*(Maybe baybeh, I’ll have you-hoo-hoo)*

“These of course,” says the mechanic, “are Buddy Holly *and the Crickets*. Singing *Maybe Baby*”.  
​	“You’re cheating\!” I shout.   
​	“We’re all cheating, little girl”.   
​	And so on.

"And I'll tell you one other thing\!" says Barry. He's drunk. “There is no such thing as the Day of Appreciation For the Italian-American anything\! My papa fought in the war and Italy was part of the axis\! So there\!”  
​	Eddie looks miffed at that comment.   
"I'm sure I'll get the *next* one, Barry. I'm sorry", I say.  
There’s quite a crowd around us: the drunk, half awake now; Larry, a short man in a dirty apron; the gas station attendant, Max; a couple of early barflies; and Eleanore and Tim, who slinked in looking all guilty.   
​	“And I’ll tell you another\!” slurs Barry. “You’re — you — I know your name is Eddie\! We all do\!” He turns to the crowd for support and finds none.   
​	“Alright,” says the mechanic whose name is Eddie, “I’ll give you *that*.”  
​	“You know, Bear, there's really no need for him,” says Tim. “I told you I got it.”  
​	“Did you really fix it?” Asks Cindy, cozying up to him.  
​	“Sure did, kid,” He flashes a proud smile at her.   
“You — you don’t — you’re not getting it,” says Barry. “Now it’s the principle of the matter\! Beat him already, Alice in Woner — in Wondrous — just beat this clown\!”  
​	I take a deep breath. “I’m ready,” I tell the set of black eyes.   
​	“Alright, Alice in Wonderousland,” says Eddie. “Ready?”  
“Ready”.   
​	The jukebox plays a guitar sound that bends and winds like… well, like a broken-down jukebox. Eddie kicks it after four notes.   
​	“I don’t — you’re cheating again\! This wasn’t two bars\! I mean I know it’s—”   
​	“Hey, girl,” says Eleanore, looking at Eddie. “You can see he’s *conning* you, right?”  
​	“What do you mean?” I whisper. Eddie looks at her with interest.   
​	“He’s obviously playing songs that sounds like *other* songs, songs he thinks you’ll know.”  
​	Eddie raises an eyebrow.  
​	“Tim,” asks Puppy. “What song is it, really?”  
​	Tim thinks. “I mean, it sounds like *Bye Bye Love…”*  
​	“Time’s up,” says Eddie.   
​	“But it’s really *Rebel Rouser.”*   
 	“Alright,” I shout. “It’s ‘Rising Rebel\!’ I mean ‘Rebel Rouser.’ I mean Rebel Rouser and that’s final\!”  
Eddie looks at Tim with the angriest look I’ve ever seen. Behind him, the jukebox wakes back to life, filling the room with a reverberating, bending guitar sound. Eleanore and Tim smile.   
​	The crowd is unhappy: the entertainment part of the morning is over. 

“I say,” says a defeated Eddie, “it’s such a nice, sunny day here in Durham. Why don’t we all just stay next to the jukebox and drink”.   
​	“You really don’t feel like working, ha,” belches Barry. ​	“Where are you thinking of going?” asks Eddie, trying to buy time.  
​	“Come on, we won\!” I say. “We’re going to the county fair in Richmond. You said you’ll fix it.”  
​	“What’s in Richmond anyway?” Says Eddie. “Corn on the cob? Some mouldy big band music?”  
​	“If you gotta know,” says Tim. “Not that it matters because the car’s good to go, but if you really gotta know we’re all going to see the *Seven Tops*, my friend. They play Rock and Roll. They’re from *Nashville*”. Eddie looks at him with dead eyes.   
​	I think of a big railroad engine, spewing a cloud of smoke, and a bunch of Israelites following. “And if you fix it fast,” I add, “we might also be going to see someone called *The Pillar of Steam*. I’m not sure where they’re from, but…”  
​	I stop to look at Eddie. He suddenly gets very still. He’s looking at me again with that intense stare…  
“What did you say, little girl?”  
​	“You know,” I say. I do feel like a little girl all of a sudden. “If you fix it early…”  
​	“You did say, *The Pillar of Steam*, right?”  
​	“R… right”.   
​	Eddie looks at us, then down at his glass. He picks it up and empties it all in one go.   
​	“Come,” he says. “We’ve got a car to fix”.   
​	Cindy and I look at each other, confused.   
​	The four of us carry Barry out. 

The noon sun hurts my eyes. I think about asking Tim to lend me his shades, but he’s busy supporting Barry, who seems very friendly: he’s hugging Tim and whispering in his ear. Eddie leads in front, arguing with Max. Eleanore, Cindy and I take the rear. In the back of the gas station, in the garage, the red-and-white Chevy looks like an old prize fighter snoring after a match.   
​	“This will not cost you anything, as promised…” says Eddie.   
​	“Hell it won’t\!” Says Max. Eddie ignores him.  
​	“…but I will have to ride with you to Richmond.”   
​	“Hell you will\!” Says Tim.   
​	On the counter at the garage there’s a General Electric coffee percolator and some Styrofoam cups, and Barry is pouring himself some.   
​	“If you fix it for free, you’re fired, that’s it,” says Max.   
​	“Alright,” says Eddie, and heads out.   
​	“Come on\!” I say. “Don’t go. We’ll give you a ride, right, Barry?”  
​	“Whatever,” says Barry and sips. From his face you can tell the coffee is terrible.   
​	“That’s it, you’re fired,” says Max and takes the coffee away from Barry. Nobody pays attention to him. Barry takes another cup.   
​	“Alright,” says Eddie and lifts the hood.   
​	“She’s fine,” says Tim. He’s standing next to Eddie. “It was just the carburetor. I adjusted the idle mixture. It runs like a *dream*.”  
​	Eddie looks at Tim. “Alright,” he says and shuts the hood. “Let’s go”.   
​	“Wait just a minute\!” Says Barry.   
​	“Yeah,” says Tim. “You didn’t do anything. Why should we let you ride with us?”  
​	Eddie turns to Barry. “Here’s how you should look at it,” he says. “Either your pretty friend here fixed the car, or he didn’t. If he did, fine. Great. But if he didn’t — wouldn’t it be a good idea to have a *certified* mechanic in the car?”  
​	Barry and Tim look at each other. Barry shrugs. Tim is not amused.   
​	“Okay,” says Barry. “But you’re paying for the gas”.  
​	“Sure,” says Eddie. “Max will fill her up for you.”   
​	“Hell I will. I don’t want to see you here ever again,” says Max.  
​	“It’s settled then,” says Eddie.   
​	“Good,” says Barry.   
​	“Whatever,” says Tim.  
​	“Are we going or what?” says Eleanore.    
​	But Cindy is quiet, pale: she looks at Eleanore, then at Tim. In the sunlight you can plainly see a couple of dark lipstick marks on his neck. 

It’s beginning to get pretty crowded in the car: on the bench seat in front, Tim is squeezed between Eddie and Barry. Cindy and Eleanore won’t sit next to each other anymore, so I’m the cheese in that particular hate sandwich.   
“Are you okay to drive, Bear?” Asks Tim. “Want me to take over?”  
​	“My father says, if you can’t drive after a few glasses, you couldn’t drive very well to begin with.”  
​	“That’s the spirit\!” Says Eddie. “So they say your name is Eleanore?” He flashes a smile at Eleanore and Tim stares at him. He turns on the radio…

*(“Alright alright, listener JANE and listener JOHN… Now here’s Elvis again, his last hit… ‘Great Balls of Fire…’”)*

*(yyyyou sha-ake my bones and you-a rattle my brain…)*

“See, that’s what I told you, Cindy,” says Tim. “He… he is the King. Listen to that guitar fly\!” Cindy ignores him and he looks dumbly confused.   
​	“Pffff,” says Eddie. “Weak”. He flashes his signature smile at Cindy and she obligingly smiles back, not before making sure Tim sees.  
​	“Now, have you ever heard that Jerry Lee Lewis version? He recorded it just before he disappeared. Not many people heard that one. That’s a shame, a shame. Now, Jerry Lee really *made* something out of these notes\!”  
​	“I love Jerry Lee,” I say, meaning it a little more deeply than I’m willing to show.   
​	“There’s a girl who knows what’s what\!” says Eddie. I finally get the signature smile to myself.   
I blush. “I listened to *Whole Lotta Shakin’* so much I got the record scratched,” I tell him.   
​	“But, Alice, I think even *you* know,” says Tim, so eager to save some face that he’s actually talking to me, “that Elvis is the superior artist.”  
​	“Pfff,” I say. “Weak”.   
​	Eddie and Cindy laugh.   
​	“Why are you going so slow?” Eddie asks Barry.   
​	“It’s that damn van”.   
​	Up ahead, a big, dirty old van is driving slowly on the one-lane road. Peeling black lettering on the back read AFRICAN METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH and a dark-blue plate says GEORGIA \- THE PEACH STATE. Black faces peer at us through the tarp.   
​	“My father says,” says Cindy, looking academic, “we should have segregated roads”.  
​	Eddie raises an eyebrow.  
​	“Cindy\!” Yells Eleanore. “That’s disgusting\!”  
​	“What?” Says Cindy, still angry at her.   
​	“Leave her alone, Eleanora,” says Barry. “She doesn’t know.”   
​	“What did I say?”  
​	“To think,” Eleanore says to Eddie, “that in nineteen-fifty-eight, people can still talk like that…”  
​	“You sure didn’t mind him talking like that when you took his money for your college,” says Cindy and immediately regrets it. “I’m sorry, Eleanore,” she says. Eleanore looks out of the window.  
​	“Overtake them,” says Eddie.   
​	“Now, I’m a responsible driver,” says Barry in a drunk voice.   
​	“Come on, man,” says Eddie, and waves to the people in the van. They wave back. “Live a little”.   
​	“Yeah,” says Cindy.   
​	“Come on, you two,” says Tim. “Stop listening to this grease monkey.”  
​	“No,” says Eddie. “*Start* listening to this grease monkey. Step on the gas. Start living.”   
​	“Fine,” says Barry. He steps on the gas and turns the wheel. I feel the pressure of the seat against my back…  
​	“There you go,” says Eddie. “Now take it down a notch. Don’t live too much, you’re not used to it.”  
But Barry doesn’t brake. He belches loudly, then hoots, then gives it even more gas. Tim looks worried; Eddie, too. The van disappears in the background… then the car swings and sways… Then we all rock in our seats. Cindy falls on my lap. I grab her hand. For what seems to be an hour, we spin out of control. There’s an awful noise as the wheels dig into the asphalt.   
​	Tim puts his hand on the wheel.   
​	“Nice and slow,” he shouts. “Pump the brakes\!”  
​	The car rights itself. We drive away slowly.

We all sit there, breathing hard. Cindy still holds my hand, and I notice that it’s moist.   
​	“Well,” says Tim.   
​	“Well,” says Eleanore.   
​	“Well,” says Barry. “That was—”  
​	“That was great,” says Eddie. “You lived a little today”. Tim looks at him, angry.   
​	Barry says, “I just hope no one saw us.” 

*(WEEEEEEEEEEE\! Unnnnnnngg…)*

I look back through the window. There, a big police car is heading towards us fast, with its gumball on: a little red sun floating over its white roof.  
​	“Well,” says Barry again. “Fuck”.   
​	“Barry\!” shouts Cindy.   
​	“Think fast,” says Eddie and laughs.   
​	“What’s wrong with you?” says Tim. “Are you enjoying yourself?”  
​	Barry says, “Can you smell that I’m drunk?”  
​	Eleanore shouts, “Yes, Barry\! You totally stink up the car\!”   
​	“You’d better pull over,” Eddie says. The police car is closer now, like a chasing chrome hippopotamus.   
​	“Don’t stop,” says Tim. “We can outrun him”.  
​	“Shut up, Tim,” says Eleanore.   
​	​Barry slows down and diverts the car to the gravely shoulder. The police car pulls behind us. The driver opens the door and ambles out. He’s a big ivory-handled cowboy gun with a lot of cop behind it.   
​	“Damn you, Eddie, that’s all I’m going to say,” says Tim.   
​	“What do I tell him?” says Barry. “What do I tell him?”  
​	“Hold hands, you two. Do it now,” says Cindy. She looks scared but her voice is calm and collected.   
​	“What?” says Barry.   
​	“Tim and Barry, hold hands\! Both hands\!”  
It’s hard to argue with someone like Cindy. On the side of the road, while a big-bellied Sheriff is rolling towards us like a steam engine, Tim and Barry face each other and hold hands. I look at Barry and see something in his eyes right then, some tenderness, something that I didn’t know existed… but that musing ends with Cindy’s voice:  
​	“Okay, you two. Now Barry, wipe your forehead”.   
We all get it: now they’ve both got greasy hands. Barry smirks and wipes a greasy mark across his forehead. Eddie nods in appreciation. He reaches into the glove compartment and takes out a packet of Buzz cigarettes, lights one up, takes a drag and passes it over to Tim. Tim places it in Barry’s mouth, tenderly, again the same tenderness: I wonder at it and then comes the white butt of the gun tapping on the window.   
​	We all look at Barry.   
​	“Good luck, brother,” says Cindy. Barry blows a few puffs from Eddie’s cigarette and a little cloud forms near the bowed, white vinyl headliner of the car. He fumbles for the crank and rolls down the window.   
​	A big head, its eyes covered in chrome sunglasses, its mouth covered with a waxed white mustache, and all of it scary, comes in through the window.   
​	“Well,” says the head, “It’s the damnest thing. I see we have a little joy-riding party going on here — why, little Barry McAllister Jr., is that you swinging that wheel?” He has a slow, drawling aspect to his speech, much like Cindy’s.   
​	“Good morning, Sheriff Emerson,” says Barry.   
​	“Good morning, Sheriff Emerson,” says Cindy.   
​	“Hello, children,” says the big chromed head. “What is it, then? Should I be telling your father you were driving wild? *And* smoking?”  
​	At the mention of his father, a quick transformation goes through Barry: his back straightens, his shaking hand on the wheel smoothes. He takes the cigarette out of his mouth and puts it out in the Chevy’s clean ashtray. He turns to the Sheriff, their faces nearly touching.   
​	“I’m sorry, Sheriff Emerson,” he says, losing his North Carolina accent almost entirely. “I forgot you’re not partial to the smell. I’m in fact so glad to see you here on this sunny day, because our car, it’s the *damndest thing*—” he takes his right hand off the wheel to gesture at the engine — “I mean I thought we fixed it, didn’t we, Tim?”  
​	“Thought we fixed it,” repeats Tim in a choked voice, trying not to make eye contact.  
​	The Sheriff looks at Barry’s grimy hands and face, then at Tim’s. He nods. Then at Eddie —  
​	“Why, you have a mechanic with you,” he says.   
​	Eddie takes out another cigarette. “Train mechanic,” he says.   
​	“He’s useless,” says Tim.   
​	“It’s the damndest thing,” says the Sheriff. “Do you kids need any help?”   
​	Eleanore and Cindy exchange glances. Barry did it.  
​	“Oh, I wouldn’t want to impose, Sheriff,” says Barry. “I mean, there’s a service station right down the road at South Hill, and we’re heading there right this very moment.”   
​	“You promise to take good care of her?” says the Sheriff, looking around.   
​	“The car will be as good as new,” says Barry.   
​	“No, you idiot,” says the Sheriff and looks at us. “Of your little sister. I’ll be seeing your father tonight, and I’d hate to tell him his little girl is in trouble”. Cindy ​smiles a forced smile.   
​	He takes his leave and rolls back to his car. We wait with baited breath until he drives past us, almost glib to the fact we got away.   
​	Then Barry steps on the gas.   
​	Almost everybody howls.  
​	“You did it, Bear\!” says Eleanore. Tim clasps him on the shoulder. Eddie, cigarette in mouth, claps his hands. Even I try my hand at howling.   
​	Only Cindy looks scared.   
​	“What is it, Cin?” I whisper.  
​	“Father doesn’t know I’m not at home,” she whispers back.   
​	I suddenly come to a prematurely grown-up realization: while I, like everyone I know, am afraid of my father, Barry and Cindy are actually terrified of theirs.   
Somebody turns on the radio…

*(Caaaatch-a-falling-staaar and putitin-your-pock-et…)*

"Boo\!"  
​	“Weak\!”  
​	“Turn the dial, man\!”  
​	Outside the car window, a metal sign rolls by, black with green lettering, saying “WELCOME TO VIRGINIA \- THE OLD DOMINION”, followed by the face of Kim Novak, blonde and slim and black & white, telling us Buzz cigarettes are “*A Real HONEY of a Smoke\!*”

## Track 2: Alice Gets a Book of Matches
*Mamas and daddies, sisters and friends — hold that dial. After the weather we got a hand-clapper to lift your load... And what a morning this promises to be, with the Henrico County Fair Achievement Day already under way. This is your man, Tiger Tom, coming for WANT-AM Richmond and today we are LIVE from the fair, with fantastic guests already lining up telling us all about this special day of celebration. At four, we’ll have West Virginia’s own Swan Silvertones and at four-thirty, farmer Besse Mayfield will tell us about her display at the fair. And what music shows will we have at the fair today, culminating with our guests from faraway Nashville, the Seven-Tops… Anyway, here’s Jerry Butler & the Impressions with For Your Precious Love...*

*(Yooooooor precious looahahv...)*

*Step right up!*
​	We’re walking under a giant arched marquee welcoming us to the Henrico County Fair (June 4th-12th, 13th Achievement Day) and stepping right up into the fair. It all hits me at once: the *step right up*s and the *come on down*s of the carneys and the *whizz* and *clank-clank-clank* and *ahhhh*s and *mommy!*s of the carousel, the sizzle of the meat on grills, the crunch of peanut shells under foot, the din of the crowd. 
​	“Daddy, I want you to get me a Fairy Floss!” 
​	“Darnel sure looks fancy in that green coat.”
​	“What are these white kids doing here?”
​	And over on the PA:
​	“Will the child Bernard Green, Bernard Green, report to the manager’s office near the entrance. Bernard Green, your mother is waiting for you.”
​	And, then:

*(take out the papers and the trash!)* 

I say, “it’s all so alive!”
​	Tim says, “Alright, Peggy Sue, don’t embarrass us in front of the cool cats”. 
​	Eddie says, “Since when do you know any cool cats?”
​	We walk through the midway, moving between pockets of PA sound. We stare at the stalls selling Friend Chicken and funnel cakes and pulled pork sandwiches and at the kids enjoying themselves on the Tilt-a-Wheel and the merry-go-round. I watch the midway, bustling with a huge throng of people, young parents with babies and old people and gangs of teenagers like us, all black. When we pass by them we get curious, reserved looks; people keep their distance. We are in a bubble in the crowd. 
​	“Bet you want a ride on the merry-go-round, Peaches,” says Barry. 
​	“We said we don’t call me that, Bartholimio,” I say, “and as a matter of fact, I would very much like to go on the merry-go-round.” I give Tim a look I hope will convey forlorning, a word I learned from a book. 
​	“Well, tough luck, *Alice*, we’re here to do a job and go home.”
​	“Do a job,” says Cindy, “then watch an amazing show, and *then* go home. 
​	“Right,” says Tim. 
​	“And before that,” says Eleanore, “maybe watch the biggest pumpkin awards. You guys got that down here, right?”
​	“Very funny, city girl.”
​	“And no talking to strangers, I mean it,” says Barry. 
​	A stranger walks by, says, “Who wanna talk to *you*?” and walks away. 

Over a prominent double-width stall, between a barbecue stall and a ring-toss stall, stands the white banner and hexagonal logo of Buzz Cigarettes. We lean on an empty booth’s stall and watch the pretty girls in the ugly yellow dresses, giving away samples. 
​	“…I enlisted them myself,” says Barry. “All college girls, from Bennet College back at Greensboro, all polite, fine, fully capable of representing the Buzz Cigarettes brand…”  
​	“All polite, fine,” mimics Eleanore, “giving four quarts of milk a day…”  
​	“Shut up, city girl,” says Barry, “my father says this initiative just might make me the youngest junior executive ever in Buzz history.”  
​	The PA says, “Will the child Bernard Green please report to the manager’s office next to the entrance, Bernard Green, Bernie, your mom is worried sick.”
​	Eddie takes out a soft pack of Buzz cigarettes from his overalls pocket. “Junior executive,” he says and lights it up, “now, there’s something to aspire to.”  
​	Barry snatches the cigarette away right from Eddie’s mouth. “Why,” he says and puts it in his own mouth, “what do you aspire to?” he coughs.   
​	Eddie reaches out and takes the cigarette back. “Me? I want the normal things. Success, fame…” he puffs on the cigarette, then offers it to Eleanore. “…equality between races…”  
​	Eleanore puffs on the cigarette with an elegant city-girl experience. She plays along: “equality between races… independence… working for the United Nations…” she hands the cigarette to Tim. Tim takes it between his thumb and forefinger, gives it a very cool drag:  
​	“Independence,” he says and puffs. “Driving my bike very fast… napping in the sun… beer…”  
​	Eddie looks at him. “I may grow to appreciate you, boy,” he says. Tim puffs in his face and gives the cigarette back to Barry.   
​	“I’m going for independence *and* watching my very first live show,” I say. “Can I have the cigarette?”   
​	Everybody except Eddie gives out a collective “no\!”  
​	“Independence,” says Cindy. She’s looking at her brother’s back. “That sounds pretty good”. 
​	Barry says to Eddie, “are these my cigarettes?”
​	Eleanore says, “Anyone else worried about Bernard Green?”

“Excuse me, sir, may I interest you in a *honey* of a smoke?”  
​	The cigarette girl is young, lithe, wearing a yellow-and-white uniform proudly featuring the yellow hexagons of the Buzz Cigarettes brand. Her hat is a particularly ugly, yellow pillbox, with the Buzz logo sewn on it, like a military insignia. White straps around her neck hold a yellow plastic tray displaying the many products offered by the Buzz Cigarettes Co. She’s holding on to it with two hands covered in white gloves that make her look like a cartoon bee. Looking at her feels a lot like stepping into Cindy’s and Barry’s house.   
​	Barry stands erect and proud. With thumb and forefinger he’s smoothing an invisible mustache. Eddie tries to keep a straight face, but not trying too hard. 
​	“As you can see,” says the cigarette girl, “we have for you today the best tobacco products money can buy: fine Domestic Virginia cigarettes, and for the man who knows his smoke, we also offer Turkish Blend cigarettes, and an assortment of snuffs and chewin’ tobaccis. Would you care for a free sample?”  
​	”Chewing tobaccos,” says Barry, very sternly. “Not chewin’ tobbacis. When you represent the Buzz brand, it is important that you keep to decorum.”  
​	”Are you tellin’ me how to sell?” asks the cigarette girl, cocking her head at him, more curious than angry.   
​	“Well,” says Barry, “I *am* your boss.”   
​	“Oh,” says the cigarette girl. “Then you must be Mr. B. MacAllister.” She turns to us and gives me a very inappropriate wink and adds, “...junior.”  
​	“I am,” says Barry, and starts arranging items on her tray. She puffs her bosom, letting him. “Then you should know,” she says, “that so far I’ve given out *forty-two* samples and had to restock *three times*. And it’s only an hour and a half past noon. So there.”  
​	“This may be the case,” says Barry, still arranging the products on her tray, “but when you represent… hello. What’s this?”  
​	He lifts a loose cigarette from the tray. It has a hand-rolled kind of look and the sun going through the thin paper wrapper makes the content look more green than brown. The cigarette girl’s expression changes. I find it hard to decode whether she’s stone-faced or just terrified.   
​	“This is completely unacceptable\!” says Barry. “Completely\! Why, look at this–” we all look at the uplifted cigarette, like a sword – “as you can plainly see, this cigarette wrapper does not showcase the hexagon design nor the name ‘Buzz\!’”  
​	The cigarette girl is relieved. So is Eleanore, who gives her a private look.   
​	Then a heavy hand lands on Barry’s shoulder–  
​	“Is this Mr. B. MacAllister, Jr., I see before me?” says the owner of the heavy hand behind us.   
​	Eleanore acts fast: she grabs the green cigarette from Barry’s raised hand and stuffs it in his coat pocket. We all turn around to find two besuited, bespectacled, respectable-looking, identical-looking white men.    
​	Barry’s expression changes from shock to serenity, smoothes itself out so fast: “Hello, Mr. Farley\! Why, gang, this is Mr. Farley, our advertising executive\! Mr. Farley, please meet my sister, cousin and their friend.”   
​	“Well met, ladies,” says one of the identical besuited men and gestures towards the other. “Mr. B. MacAcllister, Jr., I’d like you to meet Mr. C. Evans, the Fair’s executive manager.”  
​	”Well met,” Mr. Evans says.   
​	“Well met,” replies Mr. B. MacAllister, Jr. and gives a well-honed, respectable nod.   
​	”Mr. B. MacAllister, Jr. here is our fastest-rising young star, you know,” says one of the identical men to the other, “a chip off the old Mr. B. Sr., I should say. Why, this whole cigarette-girls project today was his idea, you know.”  
​	”Is that *right*?” says Mr. C. Evans.   
​	“It sure *was*, Mr. Evans,” says Barry. “Opening new doors for the Buzz brand is what it’s all about.”
​	“I’m going to die of boredom,” whispers Eleanore. “That’s what it’s all about.”
​	Mr C. Evans says, “but is this…” he gestures at the crowd — “even a *lucrative*, I mean *profitable*, market for you guys at Buzz?”
​	“Any Buzz smoker is a welcome member of the Buzz family,” says Mr. Farley. 
​	“Why,” says Barry, eager to make his point, “our representative here — he shoves the unwilling cigarette girl into the spotlight — “has already given out *forty-two* samples and had to restock *three times*. And it’s only an hour and a half past noon. And she is only one of our fine, fine…”  
​	”Edwardo\!”  
​	The voice is fierce, low, piercing through the racket. It is soon thereafter joined by the biggest body I’ve ever seen — a tall, fat black guy in overalls — moving swiftly towards us. I notice with interest that the only ones who stops to flinch is Eleanore and Mr. C. Evans.   
​	Eddie raises his head towards the big guy —  
​	“Edwardo\!”  
​	”Holy shit, it’s Besame Mucho,” says Eddie, smiling a big smile at Mr. C. Evans, who looks offended. He gives us all a little look —  
​	“See ya later, kids. Mucho, you old fart.”  
​	“Eh, as I was saying,” says Barry. “Ehm—“
​	The man called Besame Mucho runs to Eddie and picks him up like a ragdoll, giving him a bone-crushing hug.   
​	“Where are you man? I don’t see you since the woodshed\!” 
​	They walk away, talking. We all look at them.  
​	“Hey, wait,” says Eleanore, “I’m coming, too.”
​	"Yeah,” says Tim. “Wait up, Eleanore.”
​	Cindy says, “Happy to meet you, Mr. Evans, Mr. Farley.” She takes my hand and we run away as fast as we can.

A few people are sitting on folding chairs next to a big tent. Eddie and the huge man are walking towards them, with us as a rear guard. As Eddie gets closer to the group, they all jump from their seats, shouting:
​	“You son of a bitch!”
​	“Is that Edwardo or am I trippin’?”
​	“Boy, you have some nerve!”
​	“Alright everybody alright, relax won’t ya? I missed you guys too.” He hugs the pretty lady who’s standing there, saying nothing. She hugs him back but continues not to talk. Then Besame Mucho hugs him again. Then they all hug and pat him on the shoulder. 
​	“Ah,” says Eddie, “these are Alice and her friends. These unwitting sages, Alice most of all, informed me you sons of bitches have finally broke loose.”
​	“Then you have done us a great service,” says a man in a deep foreign accent. He has his hand around Eddie’s shoulder. I’ve never seen a man dress like that, a ceremonial garb of another people, perhaps — a white cotton dress, full of red and purple embroideries. His cap is made from the same clothe. 
​	“And these,” says Eddie, “are some of my old friends. I don’t want to scare you, Alice, but some of these people are actual, factual members of the Pillar of Steam Band”.	
​	I look at them: Eddie, Besame Mucho, the foreign man, the pretty woman — small, voluptuous, with short curly hair and big earrings, looking like a down-to-Earth Dorothy Dandridge; and a serious-looking man in a brown shirt, with a wide smile and thick, thick hair. 
​	“What do musicians look like?” I ask. They laugh. 
​	“Good answer, good answer.”  
​	“My name is Babatunde,” says the man in the dress. He’s got a quiet, exotic speech: soft and commanding. “On behalf of the Steam Pillars, and its friends, we would like to thank you, Alice. We were apart and now that Edwardo is with us we are whole again.”
​	“Hello, Batunde,” I say. “I think you’re a musician, because other jobs won’t allow you to dress like that.”
​	Batunde laughs. “Very good, Alice. I am a percussionist with the band. 
​	“What does percussionist mean?”
​	“Means he ain’t no drummer,” bellows Besame Mucho. 
​	Babatunde laughs. 
​	“He ain’t no drummer,” says the woman, “he is a *magician*. I’m Vilma, Alice and friends. I sing for the band. And I’m… happy you brought Edwardo back to us.” She has a small voice, like a girl’s. 
​	“I’m Johnny Terry,” says the man with the thick curls. “I’m with the choir, you could say.”
​	“You guys have a *choir*?”
​	“Are you convinced yet?” Asks Eddie. “Or do you guys want to still go see the Seven-Tops?”
​	“Hey, why are you like this?” Says Mucho. “Show some respect. Some of these cats can *rock*.”
​	“All I’m saying,” says Eddie, “is after the Pillar of Steam… I don’t think there’s going to be any of another show.”
​	“Are you being metaphorical?” Asks Cindy. “Have everybody met? I’m Cindy and this is my brother Barry and my cousin from New York City Eleanore.”
​	I suddenly realize that apart from Eddie, all the people are black, and reflect briefly on how much I’ve grown since this morning. I’m tingling with excitement. 
​	“You guys are real musicians! With a choir!”
​	“Just cogs in the machine,” says Mucho. 

Barry comes over, looking very smug. 
​	“So. Saw you talking to the brass,” says Eddie.  
​	Barry puffs his chest. “What’s it to you?”
​	“Nothing, nothing, nothing. I just didn’t know you’re an important guy.”
​	“Just a cog in the machine,” laughs Barry. 
​	“You didn’t seem to me like a cog when you were ordering that cigarette girl around.”
​	“Well,” says Barry, suddenly sounding a lot like his father, “sometimes you need to be firm.”
​	“You enjoy telling others what to do,” sighs Babatunde.   ​​	“Well — I mean — hello, I’m Barry,” says Barry.  
​	“I used to like telling people what to do, too,” says Babatunde. “It’s human nature. Don’t feel too bad about that.”  
​	“Right. Right,” says Barry.   
​	“What kind of people did you get to order around, Babatunde?” I ask.  
​	“Well, Alice, *my* people. I’m a prince of my people, you see, a member of the royal family. And when I told them they should jump – they didn’t even stop to ask, ‘How high?’”  
​​	“You’re a *prince*?”  
​	“I am. But you know, Barry, I was never happy telling people what to do. I was never happy until I came to this land and started playing music. Can you guess why?”  
​	“Why?”  
​	“Because it’s only when I stopped ordering people around and started playing music with them when I… well…” he looks at Johnny Terry – “well, in your religion there’s the idea of being subject to one another. Of submitting to one another.”  
​	“As Christ is subject to his Church,” says Johnny.   
​	“...when you play music with others, sometimes you lead. Sometimes you follow. When you lead you do so without authority, and when you follow you do so without coercion. And thus, my friend, beautiful music is made.”  
​	“Well —“ says Barry. Absentmindedly, he reaches for his coat pocket and takes out the hand-rolled cigarette he confiscated from the cigarette girl. He takes out a yellow Buzz Cigarettes matchbook and lights it.    
​	“Boy, that tastes real funny,” he says. He hands the cigarette to Tim, who puffs on it, then opens his eyes real wide. Some of the band members laugh.   
​	“Smells funny, too,” says Tim. He hands the cigarette to Eleanore and winks at her. “What do you think?”  
​	Eleanore takes a few expert draws.
​	“Yeah,” she says. “It’s fine. You should smoke it, Barry, it’s good for your nerves.
​	“Is it?” Says Vilma. “Let’s test it to be sure.” Eleanore passes the cigarette over and Vilma purses her lips and draws from it. She leaves lipstick marks on the butt. 
​	“Yeah, yeah,” he says. “It feels like a safe smoke. What do you think, Babatunde?” He passes the cigarette over and Babatunde smirks and draws from it, then passes it over to Mucho. Mucho draws and bellows, “it’s very good for you, Barry.”
​	Barry takes the half-smoked cigarette. 
​	“Is that hygienic?” I ask. For some reason, they laugh.
​	“Is that the cold, *crisp taste of Coke I see in a bottle before me?” Says Barry. 
​	“See?” Says Eleanore. “You’re already better.” 

We walk around the fairgrounds, waiting for the show to start. We pass an ice cream stand, where a young girl is crying over a fallen cone. When we pass by, she stops crying and stares at us. Eleanore draws closer to Tim, and Cindy watches that with disdain. 
​	“Tim,” she says, “will you win me a teddy?”
​	At the next stall, under the string of bare lightbulbs, the hand-painted sign at the nearby booth says “10 shots \- 25¢,” and the red-faced man in the open-collared shirt under it is busy counting shots of .22 into the hand of a young black patron, who’s chatting excitedly with his girlfriend. A bunch of old Winchester rifles lie at the counter. The man is picking up one of them and shooting into the depths of the booth, where metal cutouts, shot to tatters, are supposed to imitate ducks and quails. 
​	Every time a rifle fires, the red-faced man jumps.   
​	“Excuse me,” says Cindy in her charming voice, “this young man would like to win me the largest teddy bear you have.”  
​	”That would be the Bear-gineer,” says the red-faced man and wipes a handkerchief across his sweaty forehead. He gestures towards the top shelf above his head, where a large bear, wearing a train engineer’s hat and overalls, is sitting. 
​	“Gotta warn you, young man, 12 days so far and no one won him yet.” The man next to us fires a round into the line of automated duck-like things and it spins around its axis with a *ping\!*  
​	The red-faced man shudders.   
​	“What do I need to do to win?” says Tim and puts a quarter on the counter. The man at the counter counts ten shots into his hand.   
​	“Ten shots at the ducks and quails,” says the man and jumps at another ping\!, “and I’ll be counting”.   
​	“That will not be a problem,” says Tim, picks up a rifle and immediately drops half his shots to the ground.   
​	“Have you ever fired a rifle before?” asks Cindy.   
​	“Sure have\!” says a blushing Tim. He pulls the lever on the old rifle and drops the rest of his shots. He ducks, takes one shot from the ground, cleans it against his shirt and puts it in the rifle. He smiles at me, trying to save face. Eleanore smirks. He aims, fires — and takes the Bear-gineer’s eye out. The shot teddy flops in its place like an injured cowboy.   
​	“At the ducks and quails\!” shouts the red-faced man. “Not the trophies\!”  
​	Tim smiles weakly at Cindy.   
​	Cindy says to Tim, “why don’t you put another quarter on the counter?” And to the man at the counter, “mind if I try?”  
​	”Why not,” says the man, shuddering again, “to be worser off than him… you’d have to be *spectacularly bad.”*  
​	”Sorry, Cind,” says Tim. “You want me to try again?”  
​	”Oh, you sweet, summer child,” says Eleanore.   
​	“That’s okay, hon,” says Cindy. She winks at Eleanore. Eleanore catches the gesture, not quite sure what to do with it.   
​	“Remember we used to do these back in ‘Bama?”  
​	”That was a long time ago,” says Eleanore and walks away, towards Barry and his identical executive friends. But she looks back, somewhat appeased.   
​	Cindy turns around and picks up the old Winchester like a trained soldier. She sends her left leg back, like a ballet dancer, like an expert shot. She puts the rifle to her temple and I can tell that there’s a longstanding familiarity about it. I look back: Eleanore is behind me, watching too.
​	“Turn around, girl,” she says, “you’ll miss the show… it goes by awful quick.”  
​	I turn around just in time to watch Cindy squeezing the trigger, once, twice, ten times, barely breathing, and five ripped-metal ducks and five tattered quails going *ping\!-*ing and spinning away. The red-faced man backs away. So do some of the patrons and competitors at the shooting booth. In this moment, even I can feel there’s something very much intimidating in soft, sweet, blue-eyed Cindy.    
​	Cindy puts her gun on the stand. The red-faced man reaches above him without taking his eyes off of her and gives her the one-eyed Bear-gineer. She smiles softly and gives it to Tim.   
​	Tim takes the teddy, all red. Some people laugh — not many, though.   
​	“Hey, hey,” he says to the faces around us. “I deserve it, right?”  
​	He smiles at Cindy and walks away. 

We stand alone by the shooting booth. Life has resumed its course, ducks-a-pinging and the red-faced man a-jumping, but some people still avoid Cindy and me when they walk by, giving us a wide berth.   
​	“That was a stupid thing I did,” says Cindy. 
​	“What did you do, boo?”
​	“I angered Eleanore.”
​	“Thought that was your plan all along.”
​	“Yeah, but I think I overdid it. And she *is* my ticket out of here.”  
​	My eyes suddenly fill with so much tears that I can’t see anything and to hide that I’m looking down. 
​	“What do you mean, your ticket out of here?” I ask her shoes.   
​	“Listen, Peach — I mean listen…”   
​	I shuffle my feet. “You still owe me an explanation,” I say.   
​	“I do,” says Cindy. “But why do we have to talk about such sad things? Eleanore has an apartment, next to Emerson College.” She holds both my hands. “You could come with me, Alice of Wonderland”. 
​	“I’m too young to run away from home.”
​	“I know, I know, Wonderland Girl. But me…” she’s looking away. 
​	“What will you even do without me?”
​	“I don’t know, Peach. I don’t know. All I know is since mama passed away… I can’t be in the house anymore.”

Over the past hour I have come to a decision. During the show, I will wait for that tingle in my underwear that Eleanore warned me about. At that moment I will reach into my handbag and throw my extra pair of panties onto the stage. It will be my rite of passage into adulthood.

The tent is the largest thing on the fairground, a big balloon in stripes of red and white, radiating sunlight, its flaps raised to welcome patrons. Inside, it looks cool and dark, and rows and rows of seats are already filling with teenagers and families. 
​	“Hey you white kids\!”  
​	The policeman stands at the rear of the tent, just behind the last row, in matching khaki shirts and pants and an oversized straw campaign hat. He has a wooden baton stuffed in his leather belt. On his shoulder there’s a patch that reads “Sic Semper Tyrranis.”
​	“Hey you white kids! Come over here!”
 ​	We do. 
​	“What are you kids doing here today?” 
​	For a short man, the cop has quite a presence. His voice booms and reverberates over the noise of the crowd. 
​	“We’re—we are on official—“ starts Cindy. 
​	“We’ve a permit,” I try to end. 
​	Puppy adds a pantomime act: she sours her face at the cop, letting him know on *whose* *side* she is. 
​	Barry walks straight at the cop, then smiles. How easily he slips into that pose, I think. 
​	“We’re here on special permission from Mr. C. Evans, the fairground’s general executive,” he says. He calmly toys with his bottle of Coke. The cop responds in relaxing, too. He seems to be more interested in the cold, crisp taste of Barry’s coke bottle. 
​	“I don’t want any trouble,” the cop tries weakly. He’s looking at the cold, crisp bottle as he does. 
​	“Of course,” says Barry. “Are they treating you well here?”
​	“‘salright,” says the cop, defeated. 

“What do you think he meant?” asks Eleanore.  
​	”Who?” I ask.  
​	”Eddie.”  
​	“What do you mean?” I say.   
​	“He said, ‘after *this* show, there won’t be another one.”  
​	At the other side of the tent, Eddie, Jimmy and some other stage-hands are making the people in the first rows get up, and they do, moaning and shouting at Eddie.   
​	“He was being metaphorical,” says Cindy. 
​	“Gotta have a place to do the dancing,” Eddie says to the patrons. “Sorry sorry sorry, gotta make some room for the dancing…”  
​	Eddie and his friends move efficiently, lifting the heavy wooden benches that make up the first rows. They push them to the sides, making them look like battlements protecting the stage.   
​	“Maybe it’s like Carol Burnett on the Ed Sullivan show last year,” says Tim.   
​	“Huh?” Says Barry.   
​	“Her act followed Elvis’s,” says Tim. “You could see in her face she *did not* want to be up there on stage. So maybe *this* show will be so good, the Seven-Tops wouldn’t want to come on after—”  
​	“You kids and your *Elvis*,” says the cop, still eyeing the sweating bottle of Coke in Eddie’s hand. “Listen carefully, kids. I don’t want you white folks dancing here today. This is their day. And I don’t need any mixin’ going on here. Do you all get me?”
​	Besame Mucho is coming up on stage. Some people applaud, but Mucho is there just to shove the upright piano to the back of the stage. He does it with three fingers. The piano makes an awful dragging sound. 
​	Eddie walks over towards us, full of purpose. Then he stops. He stands next to Barry, looking around, smiling at the cop. 
​	When the cop looks away, he leans over, very secretive: “hey. Hey, Barry.”
​​	“What?”
​	“Don’t — don’t look at me. Keep staring at the stage, keep smiling, now that’s a trooper. Hey, Barry. Hand me that Coke.”
​	“What?”
​	“Shh—“
​	“I’m looking at the stage, I’m looking at the stage. Here.”
​	He hands the bottle and Eddie grabs it. 
​	“Thanks,” he says. 
​	He walks over to the cop. “Excuse me, good officer of the law. I regret to inform you that right outside this tent, where the long eye of the law cannot reach, some white youths are mixing with black youths, perhaps planning to do mixed dancing.”
​	“Why, this is very serious!” Says the cop. He hurries outside. Eddie winks at us and goes back.
​	“What just happened?” Says Barry. 
​	Puppy says, without taking her eyes off the stage, “I think he just took your Coke.” 

A well-dressed man in a seersucker, all white-and-blue stripes, and a slim, yellow tie, comes on stage now. He’s got blood-red shoes. He’s wearing a porkpie hat, slightly cocked on his small head. Some people clap. Some people call “Tom!”
​	I’m already excited.   
​	“Now you folks, how ya feel this afternoon?” He bellows into the mic. Someone yells back, “I’m feeling fine\!”  
​	”That’s good, that’s good,” says the MC. “I’m your man, Tiger Tom, and folks, we’re here in the cool shade of this big tent, cool as the James river when it’s morning, we’re here, folks, to celebrate the best in music and achievement, to feel the *joy* of music, the *best* of our community\!”  
​	”Hell yeah,” says Tim. He’s holding on to Eleanore. I slide up to Cindy and give her a squeeze. Barry stands alone next to the cops, erect, sweating in his oversized coat.   
​	“And let’s get our spirit rising\! Let’s have our hand a clapping\! Let’s give a *Richmond* welcome to the first band comin’ your way: The Cloud Pillar\!”  
​	”Steam Pillars!” Someone yells from behind the tent.   
​	“That’s right, the Steam Pillars, coming to play to us live music, folks\!”  
​	”*And* they’re not here yet\!”  
​	Tiger Tom is unfazed. “And, folks, gentlemen and gentle women,” he says, voice rising, as behind him he’s signaling at whomever is there to get the hell *on* with it, “we will momentarily enjoy their tunes and their numbers, which will serve to *elevate* us\! To *educate* us\! To *edify* us\! Thank God, here they come\!”  
​	He scurries off stage. 

Mucho climbs on stage again, holding a huge, upright bass in one hand, like he’s holding a mandoline. Now the people who applauded before know better and they don’t clap. But it seems my first show is starting. Mucho is setting the bass down and plucking a little rythm on it that makes my leg jump and tap. I sing to myself, over the song of the base: “boom, ba-ba-boom-boom, boom, ba-ba-boom-boom”. I hug Cindy, who sways and swoons. 
​	“Better not let that cop see you dance like that, Alice of Wonderland,” she says. 
​	Now Babatunde climbs on stage, smiling and waving at the crowd. As he comes on, he says, “how are you guys feeling today?”
​	“We’re feeling great, Babatunde!” calls Cindy. 
​	Babatunde sits behind a huge caulderon covered in animal hide. If it’s a drum, I think, it’s the biggest drum I’ve ever seen. He raps his fingers on it. Suddenly Mucho’s little bass rythm has a drum rythm friend to dance with. 
​	Johnny Terry climbs on stage. Someone yells, “Hi there, Johnny!” And some people clap. He finds his place behind Mucho and starts singing into the microphone in a low, low voice:
​	“*Go, go, go*…”
​	Johnny’s voice and Mucho’s bass and Babatunde’s drum all vibrate through me. I can feel them in my chest, in my feet, in my butt. A tall, broad-shouldered woman comes on, taking her place in front, wearing a black dress and an afro and holding a shiny, golden electric guitar, slim and small in her large hands.   
	​“Holy hell, it’s a Broadcaster\!” Says Tim.
​	 Eddie throws the woman a line and she catches it, plugs it to her guitar. The tent explodes in an electrified howling scream — not at all pleasant. The crowd is stirring. Eddie slaps a large crate, covered in yellow tweed. The howling stops. The crate sits there, buzzing and vibrating.   ​	“That’s a Bassman amp, Eleanore, see?” Says Tim.   
​	“Shut up, Tim\!” I say, very excited. “Don’t ruin my first show\!” I slip my hand into my purse, feeling my change of underwear. I imagine my panties landing on Mucho’s head and giggle.   
​	Babatunde’s drumming intensifies. I can really hear my heartbeat drumming the same song. I look at Cindy and notice that she’s dancing. Upon closer inspection, it seems that I am dancing, too. 
​	“Oh wow,” I say. 
​	Now Johnny walks to the front of the stage. He raises his arms and claps along to the rhythm. The crowd starts clapping with him. 
​	Now a white man comes on stage. 
​	“Am I seeing what I think I’m seeing?” says Eleanore. 
​	The white man has black curly hair and even though it’s pretty dark in the tent, he’s wearing dark sunglasses. He climbs on stage, doesn’t look at the audience, and sits behind the piano.
​	“Boo!”
​	“You idiots will get us all into trouble!”
​	The clapping ebbs out. But Johnny Terry keeps clapping, and Babatunde and Mucho still play their matching rythms. Some people clap harder. Then Vilma comes on in a blue evening dress and the shouting stops. 
​	The pianist lays his left hand on the piano and adds another rythm:

(Ta-ta-tana! Ta-ta-ta-na!)

The audience claps:

(Ta-ta! Ta-ta!)

And Vilma lays the microphone down to her face and sings softly, softly, over the many rythms,

(When Israel was in Egypt land…)

And all the men answer her in harmony:

(LET MY PEOPLE GO!)

Vilma’s voice grows. Suddenly she doesn’t sound like the little girl she was before the show:

*(Opressed so hard they could-not stand!)*

*(LET MY PEOPLE GO!)*

Now the guitarist hits the strings. I’ve never seen an electrical guitar being played before. I watch in awe as the movements of her hands translate into the huge sound suddenly filling the tent. The sound twangs and dances, and she’s dancing along with it. I notice her fingernails are painted red. The red dots dance on the strings. Some people shout and howl, some, not many, jump to their feet and start dancing. 
​	“Alright, come over here,” says the cop, returning to the tent. “What’s your name? Miss, may you please stop dancing when you’re addressing me?”
​	“My name is Alice,” I shout through the music, “this is my first show, and I can’t stop dancing.” This is very frustrating. 
​	The cop is thinking. I know I’m blushing. Cindy is dancing up to Eleanore, smiling at her. 
​	“Alright, tell you what we’ll do, Miss.” The cop looks at me. “I was young once. You and your friends, you can dance a little. Okay? But you dance among yourselves — over *there.*”
​	“In the corner?”
​	“Listen, Miss…”
​	“Alright, alright!”
​	“Barry, grab Tim when you come over!”

I look at the crowd. Everybody is dancing. The crowd is swaying with the guitar and the singing, thumping their feet to the rhythm of the drums, the piercing jabs of the horns. Everywhere a butt still kisses a seat, there are people pulling at strangers’ hands, cajoling.  
​	Now the choir of men’s voices rises and the crowd, slowly, starts to sing with them:

*(waaaaaay dooooown in Egypt-land!)*

“Let my people go!” I shout. 
​	“What did you say?” Asks the cop. He’s now suddenly looking at the white man on stage. 
​	The tent is alive with movement and sound. From our corner of the tent we look in envy at how, where things are happening, some people are actually dancing on the seats of the benches. 
​	“Why, this is very, very serious!” Says the cop, “I gotta go get—“ and leaves the tent again. 
​	I look at Tim dancing and it hurts my heart. The drums, the bass, the guitar and the piano all elevate this pain to a level I don’t recognize. The tent is swaying and swooning. Tim leaves the corner and wanders around the tent, dancing with the black people in the crowd. 

*(Tell old… Pharaoh…)*

“Dare to dance?”
​	“Huh?”
​	He’s an older boy, black, well dressed, slim. He has a polite smile on his face. He offers me his hand. 
​	“Dare to dance?”
​	“Do you mean ‘care to dance?’” I shout over the music. 
​	“No.” He offers me his hand again. I look at Cindy and Eleanore. They nod — go on!
​	I take the young man’s hand. Vilma’s voice is huge now as she’s banishing the old Egyptian kings, as big as the guitar. The two sounds — one a clear, beautiful bell, the other an electrified, howling wave — entwine and bounce off each other. 
​	As I walk with the boy out of the corner, Babatunde changes his rythm again. The band moves and changes with him, swiftly. Suddenly the music is very quick indeed. Suddenly I’m in a boy’s arms, dancing. Mucho’s bass is loud in our feet. 
​	“You smell good,” I tell the boy. 
​	“What?” he shouts. 
​	“I said my name is Alice! Alice of Wonderland!”

The whole tent is now dancing, clapping, shouting “let my people go!” and stomping to the rythm. I see white kids on the fringes of the crowd, dancing; I turn around to see Eleanore dancing with some other black kids. Even Barry seems to be almost nodding along. Cindy grabs his arm, makes him dance. They dance holding hands, like they used to do in Christmas parties when we were in junior high. Some people come over and dance with them. 
​	Now the music picks up tempo and heat, and the weight of sweat in the closed, packed tent is extreme—
​	“See? What did I tell you? A white musician!” 
​	The cop returns with backup in the form of mr. C. Evans. 
​	“This is very serious!” Says Mr. C. Evans. 
​	“What did I tell you?”
​	“You guys are not going to ruin the show, right?” I ask. 	But Mr. Evans doesn’t answer — his gaze is stuck on Barry, dancing along with some black kids. 

The guitarist stands next to Vilma, dwarfing her. They’re both sweating, red-faced; the intensity of their music almost brings down the tent — 	
​	And then: silence. All the musicians quiet up together. The crowd freezes. It seems we all wait with baited breath…
​	And then, with slow, deliberate motions, Vilma grabs the microphone stand and lies it down, close to her. And alone, over the dense quiet of the crowd, she sings, softly…

*(Oh, let us all from bondage flee—)*

And the choir:

*(Let my people…)*

*(GO!)*

—everybody joins in: band and crowd. It’s one last, lingering beat. I see Babatunde drumming his thumb and forefinger on his giant drum, creating a fluttering sound. My whole body flutters.
​	The crowd erupts in applause. 
​	“Oh. Oh my,” I say. That’s all I can say, so I say it again: “oh my.”
​	“What should I do?” Says the cop. 
​	“Shut it down,” says Mr. Evans, takes one last look at Barry, and leaves. 
​	The cop barrels down the aisle. 
​	“Ladies and gentlemen,” says Vilma, looking at the cop. The pianist plays a slow, thumping groove. “Ladies and gentlemen, I do hope you made the most out of our short time together. We were the Steam Pillars!”
​	She runs away from the stage. 
​	Just then, the cop, breathing and red, climbs on stage. He grabs the drum and Babatunde and him play tug of war with it. It sounds like thunder. Mucho, seeing this, lifts his bass and goes into the audience, playing along with the piano. People laugh and clap, letting him through. The cop leaves Babatunde’s drum…

(drrrapappapa!)

…and leaves to follow Mucho. Babatunde, Johnny and the guitarist wave at the crowd and leave. Everybody laughs. The cop’s face gets even more red. He grabs Mucho, who trips, drops his bass, then runs through the crowd. 
​	The only men on stage are the white pianist, playing the ridiculous sound, and Eddie, standing there and shaking Barry’s bottle of Coke to the rhythm. 
​	The cop climbs the stage. He grabs the pianist by the collar. The music stops. The crowd is booing—
​	Next to the amplifier, Eddie is shaking his Coke bottle. Just as it seems the cop managed to grab the man, Eddie is emptying the coke into the buzzing amplifier. A huge cloud of acrid, sweet smelling steam fills the stage. When the cloud clears, all that’s left on stage is the cop.
​	“Everybody,” says the cop into one of the microphones. “Everybody. Due to the outrageous nature—“
​	He is greeted with a wall of boos. 
​	“You are all ordered to clear the tent!”
​	“Boo!”
​	“Bring Tiger Tom back!”
​	The cop leaves the stage and barrels towards us. The people in the aisles clear the way for him. Most patrons are leaving now. 
​	“Hey, hey, mamas and papas,” says the promoter in the garish suit, hurriedly taking control of the microphone, “ladies and gentlemen, let’s be gentle, let’s be kind!”
​	”And you, you white kids,” says the cop, coming towards us, “I told you once, go home, get the hell out\!”  
​	”That wasn’t a show\!” I shout at the cop. “That was *one song*\! That doesn’t even *count\!”*  
​	”I’m sorry about your first show, Alice,” says the cop, his face taking on a medically dangerous shade of crimson. “Now out with all you all\!”   

We are hurried out of the tent by a mass of people. As I leave I stumble into the well-dressed boy who danced with me before. He grabs my shoulders, holding me in place. He’s smiling. He puts his hand on mine, placing something in my palm. With his other hand he closes my fist around it.
​	“Time to stop idling at the station, Alice of Wonderland,” he whispers in my ear. “Ready to come on board?”  

## Track 3: Alice Goes Down a Rabbit Hole

*“…And now we swing on over to local happenings, where the bright airs of the Henrico County Fair’s Achievement Day turned mighty stormy this afternoon... Police were called in after what they flat-out called ‘riotous behavior’—and not just the crowd, but the performers too, got into the ruckus! Officers stepped in quick to settle things down. Fair boss, Mr. C. Evans, gave a statement, and I quote: ‘We have laws in this country, and no amount of celebration will distract us from upholding them…’ Strong words there. Now here’s the real kicker: state fair officials have shut down all the music shows for the day. That means no stage for the Seven-Tops, those radio favorites that you folks lined up to hear! Among those caught up in the fray was the son a prominent businessman. More on that story right at the top of the hour, so don’t you dare touch that dial… Right now let us bring back the smooth sounds with Dean Martin, crooning 'That’s Amore!'”*

*(Bells would sing ting-a-ling-a-ling, ting-a-ling-a-ling and you'll sing…)*

“Come on, Alice!”  
​	“I don’t want to.”
​	I’m sitting on the ground in front of the carousel, playing with a book of matches. I let each one burn until it almost reaches my fingers, then toss it in the grass. A small pile of blackened match ends sits next to me, smelling of sulfur and warm earth.
​	Everybody else is riding on the carousel. They bob up and down, rotating slowly, each in his turn appearing and disappearing from view. 
​	“Come sit with me on the horse!” cries Cindy. Her horse, of peeling white fur and fading blue saddle, is circling the platform, about to drop out of the horizon line of my sight. Eleanore, on a horse of peeling white and fading green, is riding hard on her tail. 
​	“I do not want to celebrate,” I shout after her.  
​	“I never knew a music show can be like that,” Barry says, coming into view. His saddle is fading gold and his smile is idiotic. 
​	“That was one song!” I shout. 
​	"But what a song," he replies, staring at a point above his head. "I mean seeing those cigarette girls in action, that was fine, but the music... I mean the dancing..."
​	"You don't get it," shouts Eleanore from the edge of the platform, “that show was—“
​	I shout after her, “What?” 
​	Tim is rolling into view, checking out his reflection in the gilded, bulb-studded mirrors. As a mature man he forewent the horse in favor of a carriage. His manliness is challenged by the Bear-gineer he's still holding.  
​	“Have you seen that guitarist?" he says. "​I mean did you hear what she *did* with that *guitar*?" 
​	"What show did you guys go and see?" asks the kid riding the fading yellow-saddled horse behind Tim's carriage. 
​	"It was the best show ever, man," Tim tells him. "They're called the Steam Pillars. They were on fire." The kid is about ten or twelve and obviously dressed by his mother for a special occasion: pressed striped shirt and Sunday shoes. He has thick glasses on. 
​	”You'll see other shows!” says Cindy as she reappears. Her golden hair bobs gently around her shoulders. 
​	"How?" I say bitterly. "Who will come with me?"
​	"I'll come with you!" says the kid. "My name is Bernie."
​	“I said that show was *fire!*” Says Eleanor. 
​	“It was,” I say. “It was until Barry’s friend shut it all down!”
​	"Wait, who's Barry's friend?" asks Bernie. "Come to think of it, who's Barry?"
​	“I'm Barry and Mr. Evans is a good friend of mine,” says Barry. He’s looking around the gold-painted trappings of the carousel and humming along with the tacky organ music. “The world,” he adds with a sigh, “is made up of good friends.”
​	“What’s wrong with you all?” I say. 
​	“All I'm saying,” says Eleanore, “is that this thing with the police was the best—“
​	She disappears again. 
​	“I'll come with you,” says Cindy. She has dismounted her horse and now she's walking around the edge of the platform, against the direction of the carousel. She keeps perfectly centered in my view. "All you have to do is come along."
​	I huff. “I just want you all to know that did not count as my first show,” I say. 
​	“What did she say?” says Tim. 
​	“She said she wants to go and see another show,” says Cindy and sits down in his carriage. She smiles at him. “Know any good ones?”
​	“Well,” he says. “I think the Seven-Tops should start about now, no?”
​	“That’s not funny,” I say, even though I'm laughing. “I want the Steam Pillars!”
​	“I said the police thing was the best part!” says Eleanore. “How Mucho was giving it to the cop and the crowd was having none of it… it was the best part of their performance!”
​	Barry bobs into view and says, “we should go find Eddie. He's a swell guy. He'll tell us where the band is headed.”
​	Bernie asks, "Who's Eddie?"
​	Tim asks, "Don't you have a mother?"
​	Bernie answers, "Why are you holding a teddy bear?"
​	Cindy smirks.
​	“I never felt this way,” Barry says, and then looks as though he’s surprised at his own words. Behind him, Eleanore’s horse is empty. As the platform turns I see she’s sitting at Tim's carriage, crowding in the seat with Tim, Cindy and the Bear-Gineer. 
​	“Let’s do that,” I say. 
​	“Do what?” says Eleanore. 
​	“Let’s find out where they’re headed and go there, too. Let’s go to their show!” I say.
​	"That would be something," says Barry and disappears from view.
​	Cindy thinks about it and says, “Why are you playing with matches?”
​	I say, “I got them as a gift.”
​	“From whom?”
​	“That kid I danced with,” I say, and I light another. The blue and orange flame dances between my fingers, and just as it nears my fingers it ebbs out. “He told me I should come on board, then he put those matches in my hand.”
​	“What did he mean?”
​	“I dunno.” I look at the book of matches: a standard, yellow Buzz Cigarettes matchbook. Inside the cover, someone wrote something in pencil... 
​	“Alright, we’re done, everybody get off!” says the operator. He pulls on a lever and the platform jerks to a halt. The music stops —

*(just like pasta e-fasuuuuuuuh...)*

When everybody comes around I say, “Hey Barry. I don’t know where the Steam Pillars’ next show is, but I think I know *when* it is.”

“Hot parched peanuts! Jumbo Virginia! Get ’em while they’re hot!”
​	We are standing in line at the stand, watching an elderly woman in a cafeteria worker's uniform shout as she's filling small paper packets with huge, fried, salt-encrusted peanuts. Eleanore, Cindy, Barry and Tim surround me. Bernie does, too. 
​	"What did he say, *exactly*?" says Eleanore. 
​	"She told you," says Cindy. "He said to stop idling at the intersection. It's a *metaphor*."
​	"Stop idling at the *station*," Barry corrects her. "Gee, I sure hope we'll get those peanuts soon." He watches the peanuts and licks his lips. "The important thing is that he told her to *come on board*." 
​	"What's it a metaphor for?" asks Bernie. 
​	"Why are you here, kid?" asks Tim. Bernie shrugs. "And in any case what does it matter what he said, look at what he wrote!"
​	Bernie asks, "what did he write?"
​	I show him the matchbook cover, where someone hastily penciled in, 

​	*​Tonite, 8*

​	"It's a puzzle!" Bernie calls, and adds an appreciative whistle. 
​	"I think we shouldn't discount the possibility," says Eleanore, "that he was just asking her out on a date."
​	"Our Peaches?" says Barry. "Ridiculous."
​	"Gee, thanks, Barry," I say. 
​	"It *is* ridiculous," says Cindy, and when I raise an eyebrow she adds, "even though *Alice* is a very fetching lady..."
​	"Thanks, Cin," I say. 
​	"...because if he was asking her out on a date, he would also need to ask her where he should pick her up from." Everybody, Bernie included, nod at that dating-world fact. 
​	"'Ready to come on board?', that's what he asked," I say. "On board the Steam Pillars train, that's where he invited us."
​	Bernie says, "These guys have a *train?*"
​	Tim says, "We *obviously* have to go."
​	Barry says, "Or die trying."
​	Cindy says, "But... you know, Eleanore, she has a train to cat​ch home." She tries to give Eleanore a shifty look. 
​	"Don't worry about me, Cindy," says Eleanore, not meeting her gaze. 
​	A group of men in identical green suits walks by, all looking angry. One of them is holding a trumpet case.  
​​	"Those damn Pillars," one of them says. 
​	"They'll screw you in each time," says another. 
​	"What do you want, honey?" says the lady at the stall to Barry. 
​	Then the PA comes on:
​	*(Barry MacAllister, Jr... Barry MacAllister, Jr... a phone call for you from your father in the fair's management office...)*
​	Barry abandons his position at the top of the line and starts to walk down the midway. 
​	"Is he lost, too?" asks Bernie. 
​	"See you, kid," says Tim. "We got adult business." 
​	"Alright," says Bernie. "See ya guys. Alice, if these guys don't take you to the show, think of me."
​	I give him a little kiss on the cheek. We follow Barry.  
​	"Hey Barry, what do you think your dad wants?" asks Eleanore. 
​	"Yeah," I say, trying to join in, "what do you think he wants?"
​	"No, really, Barry, did you forget your packed lunch?" says Eleanore.
​	​"Leave Barry alone, Eleanore," says Tim. 
​	Cindy says, "Do you think he's heard about the *riot*?"
​	"I think father," says Barry, walking so fast we need to scurry to catch up, "is calling to hear a report about my successful cigarette girl program."
​	"That's right," says Tim, putting a hand on Barry's shoulder, "Barry here is the man of the event, and he deserves his praise."
​	"Thanks, man," says Barry. 
​	"Maybe Barry deserves the Bear-Gineer," says Eleanore and links her arm through Tim's. 
​	"The Bear-Gineer is Tim's, *I* won it for him fair and square," says Cindy, takes the teddy and links her arm through Tim's other arm. 
​	"Alright," says Tim. "You two. I've had it." He breaks free from them and takes the teddy away from Cindy. "I'll be standing next to Alice, and you girls -- you figure out whatever you need to figure out."
​	Barry says, "Leave Tim alone, girls."
​	Eleanore says, "You never let me have anything nice, don'tcha, Cindy."
​	Mr. C. Evans' office is a trailer sat at the edge of the fair, marking the border between fun-having and car park. Three metal steps lead to a thin tin door. Barry takes a deep breath and climbs the stairs. 

"-- telling you, Dahlia, the press were all over us, cameras too --"
​	The small outer office is dominated by flowers: real ones in pitchers and painted ones in frames pictures and on the dress of the elderly woman sitting behind the table, talking on the phone. Through a doorway we can see a sparsely decorated inner office. Afternoon rays invade through the half shut blinds. The elderly woman, in glasses, seems strict. We line up behind Barry. ​	
​	"-- and that little man from the *News Leader* was absolutely horrible --"
​	"Hello," says Barry. "Mr. MacAllister, here to see Mr. C. Evans." He thinks about it and then adds, "Ehm."
​	"All this ruckus, Dahlia, and -- hold on a minute, bless your heart." She raises her gaze and tells Barry, "You can go right in, honey. Mr. Evans is not in but the telephone is right there on that table." She gestures at the doorway.
​	"Good luck, Bear," says Tim. 
​	Barry puffs his chest and enters.
​	"I finally find a nice guy and you have to ruin it for me," whispers Eleanore.
​	"Don't they have three million nice guys in New York?" Cindy whispers back. 
​	"If you must know, they're not that nice."
​	Tim whispers, "I can still hear you two."
​	Through the doorway I can see Barry putting his hand on the phone. He draws a deep breath. A big, elastic smile spreads upon his face. He puts the receiver to his ear. I can hear him exclaim, "Father, good afternoon!"
​	Mr. Evans' secretary says, "I told Mr. Evans, I said so myself, I said, 'Don't hire those Pillar people, their manager sounds shady. *And* she's a woman.' But would men listen?"
​	Cindy whispers, "You're here for a hot second and you claim possession of everything you see. What does that tell you?"
​	Eleanore whispers back, "You try to buy everything you see, with cash or with stuffed animals, what does that tell you?"
​	Mr. Evans' secretary says, "I can also hear you now, girls. Kindly take it outside."
​	Cindy and Eleanore look at each other. They leave to fight outside.
​	Tim hands the Bear-Gineer to the secretary. "This is for you, gorgeous," he says.
​	The secretary smiles. "You are a sweet heart, young man. Anyway, Dahlia, that is not the hottest story of the day--"
​	I look at Barry; he's holding the receiver to his ear but not saying anything. His lips are pursed and the blood is fast drawing away from his face. I look the other way: Cindy and Eleanore are standing outside, arguing. I summon some courage and walk up to Tim. 
​	"So," I say. "Don't I get a bear?"
​	Mr. Evans' secretary says, "Apparently, there's some top banana's son here at the fair today, and while all this brouhaha was happenin' and Mr. Evans had to go over there to straighten things up--"
​	I watch Barry, receiver to ear, as he's slowly deflating.
​	"Uh-ha," he says. "I mean -- yessir."
​	Mr. Evans' secretary says, "--so he had to tell that kid's dad that his boy was dancing with a *black girl*."
​	Cindy comes back, her face very red. 
​	"Well," she tells me, "now I have nowhere to sleep." 
​	I try to feel sad for her but fail. Outside, Eleanore is smoking a cigarette. Back in the inner office, a shrunken version of Barry is putting down the telephone receiver. He ambles slowly back to us. His face is about as red as Cindy's. 
​	"Well," he says. "Now. We're going right back home."
​	We all walk back to the car park in silence.

"And so," says Cindy, "ends our day in Wonderland."
​	I nod. 
​	"Not with a bang but with a whisper," she adds.
​	"Look at the bright side, Cind."
​	"What bright side?"
​	We two keep to the back of the procession, whispering. 
​	"That you don't have to tell Barry you'll be leaving."
​	Cindy laughs; it's not a happy laugh. I hug her and I feel how she won't lean into my hug. I feel ashamed at how jubilant I feel. 
​	"I really thought I'd be getting away this time," she says. 
​	"I know how you feel," I say and I pat her head. "I thought I'll be seeing my first show today."
​	"Yeah, roughly the same thing."
​	I link my hand through hers. "We'll have a big old slumber party when we get back," I tell her. "Just you and me."
​​
The car park is a dusty field right in view of Mr. Evans's office. Barry's car is waiting for us, red and white and smoking. 
​	"What's that smoke coming out of your car?" asks Eleanore. 
​	Barry pricks his ears, alarmed; then his muscles go limp. 
​	"I have a pretty good idea," he says. 
​	We near the car and Barry opens the back door. Eddie sits inside, still in his mechanic's overalls, smoking a cigarette. 
​	"Are those my cigarettes?" Barry asks him. 
​	==MAKE EDDIE MORE MANIPULATIVE, ALSO NOT READING THE ROOM, ONLY THEN ASKS THEM FOR A FAVOR.
​	"Shut up and listen," says Eddie. "Hi, Alice."
​	"Hi Eddie," I say. I'm hoping Tim notices how popular I've become with the boys. 
​	Eddie says, "We have a serious situation on our hand, Barry."
​	Barry says, "Yeah, we kind of really do, so if you don't mind stepping out of my, you know, vehicle..."
​	Eddie says, "I'm not kidding, Barry. It was confided to me by trustworthy sources that the police are at this very moment looking for an individual bearing a striking, but unfortunate, resemblance to yours truly..."==
​	Barry says, "Eddie -- or Edwardo -- or whatever -- I'm not in the mood, alright?"
​	Eddie reaches out from inside the car and grabs Barry by his shirt collar. "Barry," he says, "if the police would, god forbid, make this awful mistake, how will you live with yourself?"
​	Barry hangs his head back, looking up as if the clouds might be harboring a secret savior. He lets out a long, exasperated sigh. 
​	"All I wanted was to listen to some music," he says. 
​	"I know just how you feel," says Eddie. "I was having a relaxing morning back in Durham before a rowdy gang of teens swayed me off the beaten track with their soft drinks and their corner-dancing."
​	"Hate to say it, Bear," says Tim.
​	"Don't say it, then."
​	"Alright, I'll say it," says Eleanore. "We have got to help Eddie. There he was, facing the *man*..."​	
​	Cindy chuckles.
​	"Shut up, Cin."
​	"*You* shut up," says Cindy. 
​	"Both of you shut up," says Tim.
​	"Of course we'll help you," I suddenly say. 
​	Everybody looks at me. 
​	"I mean," I say and I shuffle my feet a little. "I mean, Barry, of course we'll help him, won't we?"
​	Barry looks at me and nods. 
​	"Yeah," he says. "I guess we're just mincing words."
​	==Tim says, "You got any blankets?"==

The sandy hill surrounding the fairground gives way to a dirt road, where we wait our turn at the head of a long, single-file line of cars. The air is still and the car is steaming. Up ahead, a group of khaki-clad policemen are peering through the window of a Ford pickup. Somewhere ahead, an impatient driver leans on his horn and other impatient drivers yell back. 
​	"Now," Barry says, clutching at the wheel. "I mean it. Y'all say zilch. You smile and you nod. Eleanore, what do you do?"
​	"Leave me alone."
​	"She says zilch and she smiles and she nods," says Tim. "We all do that."
​	The policeman signals us to come ahead. On the wheel, Barry's knuckles turn white. In the back seat, I take Cindy's hand. After some thought I take Eleanore's hand as well. She grabs me back. 
​	"Here we go. Smile and nod," says Barry.
​	The cop, dusty and sweating under his campaign hat on the tarmac, cocks his head at us.
​	Barry gives him a slight, almost imperceptible nod... my heart is beating so hard I can swear I hear it thudding in my ears and stomach, sounding just like Babatunde's drum. 
​	The cop, almost mechanically, returns the nod. He waves us through. 
​	We drive on. 
​	"Was that it?" I say.
​	"It's like you know their secret handshake," Tim says. There's jealousy in his voice. 
​	In the back window, the Henrico County Fair grows smaller and smaller. 

The dusty road gives way to a broad, wealthy residential street. Fancy houses sit far away from the road in the shade of large trees. Streetcar tracks cross the wide asphalt road and we rock and jerk as we go over them. It seems I have been rudely awoken from a sweet and happy dream. 
​	"There goes Wonderland," I say. "Nothing but a story to tell the grandchildren."
​	"That wasn't the show of your lifetime, it seems, kiddo," says Tim. "Sorry, Alice. I was wrong."
​	"Did he do it?" says Eddie from under the blanket beneath our feet. 
​	"Yeah, he did it," says Cindy. 
​	"So why aren't you guys cheering?"
​	"We're not in the mood," says Cindy. 
​	"And you're lying on my foot," says Eleanore. 
​	​"We're going home," I tell him. “Instead of going to the Pillars’ real show.”​	
​	I hear laughter from underneath the blankets. “What makes you think there’s another show?” Eddie says. 
​	“Your game is up,” Eleanore tells the blanket. “We know everything. It’s tonight at eight.”
​​	“And how did you come to this conclusion?” Eddie says. 
​	“Well,” I say. “I got this matchbook.” 
​	A hand shoots up from between the blankets. “Show me.”
​	I give Eddie the Buzz Cigarettes matchbook. Eddie pulls the blankets away and sits up underneath us. Cindy shrieks. 
​	“Sorry, sorry, sorry, lady,” says Eddie. He unfolds the matchbook and looks at the writing inside. ”Alice,” he says, “do you know what it means?”
​	“I know what it means,” I say. “It means other people will be having fun while we’ll be at home, crying.”
​	Eddie looks at me, then at Barry. “You!” he says. “Why?”
​	Barry sighs. “Listen,” he says to the rearview mirror. “Seeing that you’re not in trouble anymore — we’re going to the train station to drop off Eleanore, so feel very free to get off anytime, you know what I mean?”
​	Eddie leans on the back of the front seat. “What’s wrong with you?” he says. “Can’t you feel excitement anymore?”
​	“That’s what I want to know,” I say. 
​	“I *am* excited,” says Barry. “I’m really looking forward to you not being in my car.”
​	“I’m looking forward to similar things,” says Cindy, looking at Eleanore. 
​	“Shut up,” says Eleanore. “Eddie is right. Here you are, given an opportunity you will never again have in your young life, and you run back home to daddy.” 
​	“You shut up,” says Barry. 
​	“You know, she’s right,” Tim tells him. 
​	“You, too?”
​	“I’ve been to some shows, man. That was something else.”

The road ahead slopes down, down, down. We look into an ugly, overgrown valley, like a jungle road in the middle of the city. My heart sinks and I can hear it beating again.
​	"Anyone else hears drums?" says Eleanore.
​	“What did you mean?” I ask Eddie. “When you said, ‘Do you know what it means?’”
​	Eddie turns to me. He holds my hand and looks deep into my eyes. “It means you were chosen, Alice.”
​	I giggle.
​	Cindy says, “You’re the chosen one, Alice!” Eddie makes a sour face at her.
​​	Inside, I'm boiling. Was I really chosen? No matter for what, I think. When did anyone ever choose me? I hear my heart beating in my ears again, like Babatunde’s big drum.

​	*(BOOM)*

“Just tell me one thing," Eddie says to Barry. "One thing and then I’ll leave you alone.”
​	“That’ll be the day.”
​	“How did you feel?”
​	“What do you mean?” Barry says. 
​​	“When they were playing, man. When you were there listening to their music. Tell me how it felt.” 
​	Barry takes a deep breath. 
​	“It felt amazing,” he suddenly shouts. “Okay? It felt like a thousand pounds have been lifted off my shoulders... come to think of it, it was the best few minutes of my life. Alright? But now it’s over, our carriage is a pumpkin, and we’re due at our regular life, where you don’t horse around with the police and you don’t — don't -- you don’t steal people’s Cokes away.”
​	"Also," says Eleanore, "daddy called."
​	“So that's it,” says Eddie, “your father beckoned you back into your Junior Executive life. Right, Bear?”
​	"Don't call me that. Only my friends call me that."
​	"All that responsibility... making daddy proud... the nice suits... and maybe, someday, if you slave hard enough, that corner office looming in the future."
​	"Well," Barry says, "not all of us are such big fans of day-drinking." 
​	"The future is a long carpeted corridor," Eddie says. "Think about that. A long carpeted corridor terminating in a big offic​e."

In the front window, a clock tower rises above dilapidated houses, its arched top mimicking London as I've seen it in newsreels. Only this Big Ben is dwarfed by a big highway bridge being constructed above it. As we drive near the tower, it seems to have a grotesquely fancy train station building attached to its midriff. Barry parks near it. 
​	"Well," he says. "...yeah."
​	We get out of the car, gloomy and stormy in the bright summer sun. 
​	"It's been a pleasure as always," Eleanore says. "My luggage is in the trunk, then... I guess I'll be on my way." 

​	*(Boom.)*

​"Aw," says Eddie. "That is very heartwarming."
​	Barry hands Eleanore the car keys, and she walks to the back of the car. She swings the lid open and stumbles back. Out ambles a very sweaty man in foreign, ceremonial garb clinging to his body. He's holding a pink, flowery suitcase in one hand and in the other a very large drum. The drum sounds as he exits...

​	*(...boom)*

​"Oh yeah," Eddie says. "I knew I forgot something."
​	"Babatunde!" I cry. "What are you doing in the trunk?"
​	Barry and Tim shout together, "Eddie!"
​	Babatunde puts down the flowery suitcase and wipes his forehead with his huge, loose sleeve. At a concerned passerby who stops by he flashes a big grin. 
​	"Sorry, Baba," says Eddie. "That took a little longer than I thought it would."
​	Eleanore laughs.  
​	"I'm so sorry, Mr. Babatunde," says Barry. "I didn't know you were in my trunk."
​	"Feel no remorse, Mr. MacAllister," says Babatunde. He smiles at us all. "I would like to commend you for your safe and able driving. You have made my journey as comfortable as you possibly could."
​	Eleanore says, "Eddie, you little piece of shit." They both grin.
​	Tim offers Babatunde his handkerchief. "Mr. Babatunde," he says, "I can't tell you how your music effected me. I can still hear your drumming--" he points at his perfect belly -- "right here."
​	"We all can," says Eleanore. 
​	"I'm very honored," says Babatunde. He sits on the trunk and breathes hard, then wipes his forehead with Tim's handkerchief. "I'm also very sorry you won't make it to the show tonight. I apologize, but I overheard your conversation on the way."
​	"I'm sorry, Babatunde," I say. "Trust me, I'm not just saying."
​	"Well," says Babatunde. "Maybe another time, eh? Oh, Mr. MacAllister, one more thing, if I may."
​	"Yes, sir."
​	"Barry, if you end your journey now because you have decided to, I want you to know I respect you."
​	"Thank you, Mr. Babatunde. Finally some vindication."
​	"...but if your reason is that you are afraid of another man, I want you to know you do not respect yourself."
​	Barry face falls. Cindy clasps my hand. "Something pretty bad is about to happen," she whispers in my ear.
​	"Well," says Eddie. "It's been a blast. I'll always remember you, Barry."
​	"Yeah," says Eleanore. "It's been *something*." Suddenly and without notice, Cindy breaks down and hugs her. Eleanore puts on a strained face.
​	"Thank you for the transportation," says Babatunde. "Eleanore, I assume this is your bag?"
​	"No it isn't," says Eleanore, giving Cindy an apologetic look.
​	I watch Barry turning and looking at Cindy's pink, flowery suitcase, and then at Cindy.

*(Yip yip yip yip, boom boom -- click!)*
​	"I'm not in the mood," says Barry. 
​	Cindy sits next to Barry in the front seat. Tim sits next to me in the back. I sit with my hands clasped on my lap. I've never been quite this close to someone so pretty. 
​	​​"Just talk to me," says Cindy. 
​	"When were you going to tell me?"
​	"Well--"
​	"I can't believe you. I can't."
​	"I'm sorry. I really am. But--"
​	"Were you really going to let me tell Father you've run away?"
​	"I didn't think. But, Barry--"
​	"Damn right you didn't."
​	"Barry -- I can't breathe."
​	Barry shoots her a worried look. "What do you mean?"
​	"When I'm at home. I can't breath. I can't."
​	We turn left at a little sign saying NINTH STREET VIADUCT - ERECTED M.C.M.XIII - GEORGE AINSLIE MAYOR, and find ourselves on a long, tall wooden bridge, flanked on both sides by the stormy waters of the George River. In the distance, grey chimneys shoot out from the horizon. The wheels rattle on the wooden planks of the bridge and we all vibrate. It gives a comical aspect to Cindy's earnestness. 
​	"I'm a young woman," says Cindy. She's looking at Barry with pleading eyes. "I need to live. I choke at home. I choke under his control. And ever since mom died... Barry, just thinking of going back home makes me unable to breathe."
​	Barry hangs his head, so low I worry he's fallen asleep at the wheel. He's quiet for a long while. After some time, Cindy lays a hand on his shoulder. 
​	"I am sorry," she says. "Please forgive me."
​	"I can't solve your problem," says Barry. 
​	"What do you mean?"
​	"I mean I'm just a boy," Barry tells her. "A boy who's still afraid of his father. I can't solve your problem. But sister -- before we have to go back home, how about we catch a show?"
​	Cindy's nodding. She's smiling.​	Barry slams on the brakes. Behind us a car horn goes off. Barry spins the wheel and we turn around. Cars, stuck on both directions, starts honking at us. 
​	"Sorry, sorry!" Barry says. "Family emergency."
​	He backs up, turns again, backs up again. 
​	"Learn to drive!" someone shouts at him. 
​	Barry breaks free and steps on the gas. The wheel rattle on the wooden bridge. 
​	"We have to get Eleanore before she gets on the train," says Cindy. 
​	"Set sail for Eleanore!" says Barry.
​	We all cheer.
​	"Someone turn on the radio!" I say.

*(Caaaatch-a-falling-staaar and putitin-your-pock-et…)*
==chapter break== 

We run up the many stairs of the Richmond Main Street train station, a big block of columns and ornamental windows and thatched roofs. 
​	"What time is her train?" says Barry. "Did we miss it?"
​	We hear a loud *braaaaaaang* above our head. I look up to see the huge clock face showing it's half past six. The sky is pink behind the clock tower.
​	"It should be leaving now!" says Cindy. At the top of the stairs we pass a column with the inscription "1500 East" and push through the doors.
​	"Eleanore!" Barry yells. 
​	"Eleanore!" I join in. 
​	==We are surrounded by hundreds of people. Eleanore is nowhere to be found. The huge main room is all Greek columns and light from huge round windows and white marble floors and wide stone staircases reaching the train platform and little signs that say "Restrooms - Whites Only."==
​	"Run!" says Cindy. "I can hear the train. We might just get her."
​	We run towards the staircase. 
​	"We'll spread out and search," says Barry.
​	"Or," says Tim, breathing hard, "we'll go to the news stand."
​	"Why?" says Barry.
​	"Because she's standing right there."
​	To our left, a wooden stall offers NEWSPAPERS - WHITES and NEWSPAPERS - BLACKS and MAGAZINES - GENERAL INTEREST. Some people stand next to it, reading the merchandize. One of them is a young woman in a black turtleneck and black cigarette pants, reading The Richmond Afro-American.
​	We run to her. "Eleanore!" says Cindy. "Why aren't you on that train?"
​	"I was never going to go on the train," she says, still pretending to read the newspaper. 
​	"What were you doing?" asks Cindy. 
​	"Waiting for you guys."
​	She peers at Cindy above the newspaper. She winks. Cindy smiles. "Anyway," says Eleanore, "I know Barry is a good guy. I knew he'd do the right thing."
​	"Aw, Puppy..." says Cindy. 
​	"Don't call me that. Stop hugging me."
​	But she's hugging her back.

"Now, let's get serious," says Barry. "We've got a show to catch."
​	"That's right!" I say. Finally, the day is back on track. I hold the matchbook in my hand should one of my fellow detectives wish to inspect it. 
​	Tim says, "We know when it is, we need to find out where it is."
​	Cindy says, "Barry, why don't you ask your friend Mr. Evans."
​	"Very funny," says Barry. "He's the last one they would tell."
​	"It's supposed to be *obvious*," says Eleanore. 
​	"You kids doing a treasure hunt?" says the newspaper vendor. He's an old man in a felt cap, gazing at us between the hanging newspaper​​s with twinkling eyes. 
​	"We are," I tell him.
​	"We're really not," says Eleanore. "It's supposed to be *obvious*, you see."
​	​Tim says, "We sure are, sir. Do you know The Steam Pillars?"
​	"Dunno," the newspaper man says. "Are they black?"
​	"How did you know?"
​	"Because," says the man, "your friend over there is reading the amusement section in a black newspaper."
​	Cindy says, "Is it there, Eleanore?"
​	"It isn't," Eleanore says, folding the newspaper. "But that's not the point. The point is, Alice, the guy who gave you that matchbook wanted you to be in the show. He probably assumed most people who get a matchbook will know where the show will be."
​	"So where is it?" says Barry. 
​	"Well, for starters, I can tell you it's right here in Shockoe Bottom."
​	I giggle. "Where?"
​	"Shockoe Bottom," Eleanore says earnestly. 
​	"Where's that?"
​	"It's the neighborhood you're in," says the newspaper man. "So is there a treasure hunt or no?"
​	"Absolutely not," says Eleanore.
​	"But why?" I ask. 
​	"Because," says Eleanore, "I saw Eddie leave with Babatunde. And they left *on foot*."
​	"No car, then it must be around," Cindy says. "So where is it?"
​	"It's just a matter," says Eleanore, "of looking through the clubs right here in Shockoe Bottom."

## Track 4: Alice Goes to Wonderland

"He sure looks like him," she shouts.

But my ear, that has heard this voice so often, knows different. It was the same set of fingers on that keyboard, the same playful southern drawl.

"It is him," I say.

"What do you mean?"

"I mean it's friggin Jerry Lee Lewis up there on stage\!" I shout, and then clasp my fingers around my mouth: I've never cussed in public before. My heart races… a deep fantasy, ancient and hidden, has just been fulfilled. I compare the Jerry Lee in those deep memories, compiled from his likeness on album covers, to the camouflaged man on stage.

*"Kiss me, baby—ooooh\! Feels good\!"*

I do feel good.

What is *up* with this band?

————————

I stuff my panties back in my bag, feeling all grown up already before I turn to Tim and kiss the hell out of him.

————————

"There," shouts Cindy, "now we've all kissed Tim\! So we won't have to do that, ever again\!”

"I'm not sure I like what I hear," says Tim.

"Shut up," says Barry. He clasps him around the neck, a manly, friendly gesture. I'm struck by how different Barry looks now. I’m sure it’s not just the lack of coat and tie that makes him look so… so beautifully loose…

I'm looking at Cindy and Eleanore hugging. Eleanore kisses Cindy's cheek. Tim and Barry are dancing very close now, locking sights.

I choke. "I love you guys," I say.

Cindy comes over and kisses me. The need to dance subsides. We hug, but we also still kind of swoosh and sway.

"I've been to my first show," I say to her. She looks at me and pats my cheek.

"You have, Alice of Wonderland," she says. "You have".

"This was the most beautiful moment of my life," I say. "And now I fear it's gone". I start crying and she hugs me and doesn't say anything. I think she's thinking the same thing.

After a while the dancing ebbs out, like the energy running out of a lightbulb… first in a steady decline and then in sputters of sudden idleness. The thirty or so people in the room are looking at each other as if they all woke up together from a weird dream. Shy looks at first, but then looks that say *yes, I've seen what you've seen myself and you're not crazy and it did, in fact, happen, and by the way, brother or sister, how cool was that?* followed by a quiet, almost mute display of hand-shaking and cheek-kissing and shoulder-clasping… someone at the back of the room shouts, "I love everybody here" and it doesn't sound strange. In fact, it sounds oddly and quietly true.

The redheaded girl runs over to me, her freckled face beaming.

"I'm Kimberly," she says and hugs me. Her friends come over. Their names are Martha and Duke.

We all hug.

The thirty of us leave as a group.

Cindy, Kimberly and I walk outside together. In the parking lot, the Conductors are waiting for us: Eddie and Rosetta and five or six others, all holding bunches of braids and looking holy and filled with purpose. Eddie beelines towards me. I run to him and hug him and kiss his stubbly cheek.

"I've been to my first ever show, Eddie\!"

He smiles broadly and hands me a braid. It's a simple, uncolored wool braid but it has two coins slotted on it. They jingle against one another in my hand.

"What's this for, Eds?"

"For being, as I already predicted, young lady, chosen".

Then his smile fades. He says, "we leave tonight for Fuckington".

"You sound like you're saying goodbye," I say. He says nothing, just turns away. He turns to Kimberly's friend Martha and gives her a big wide smile and hands her a braid and says, "we leave tonight for Fuckington".

All around me, Conductors are handing us all braids and saying that they're leaving tonight for Fuckington.

I shout at Eddie, now far away, "hey\!"

"What, Alice of Wonderland?"

"How do you get chosen, Eddie?"

He smiles and walks away. All the Conductors are leaving, having depleted their stock of braids.

"You choose," he shouts back through the empty street. Rosetta throws her arm around his shoulder as they walk. "That's how you get chosen. You choose".

Then, for the first time since the show started, it's *actually* quiet.

Kimberly is putting on the braid Eddie handed to her. I see she already has one. The coins from her two braids all jingle together.

"Will I see you in Fuckington?" she asks. I look at Barry with a sinking heart. Now that he's outside, breathing normal people air again, what would he do?

"Will you paint on your car tonight, Alice?"

We stand there, all looking at each other.

Then this one guy walks over to his car. I think he's leaving but he bends over, reaches behind the wheel, pops his trunk open. He takes a big can of red paint and a brush and he's singing, singing to himself or to us,

*"I'm-a gonna paint me*  
*grRRREAT balls of fi-re*  
*I'm-a …bout to paint me…"*

"Another bird joins the flock," says Kimberly.

When he's finished, some other guy comes and takes the brush, turning towards his car. Somebody found a few more paintbrushes in his trunk and he puts them in the middle of the little clearing. Some more paint cans are found – candy-apple red, mint-green, midnight blue – and then some aerosol spray cans, too. One girl paints a striking image of a Tropical Turquoise heart melting over her front door. Someone transforms his '52 Bel Air into a rainbow. A group of young workmen are busy filling every surface – doors, windows, roof – on their little van with all the lyrics they could remember. They use paint, they use Magic Markers. They are humming the songs as they do that. I suddenly realize how filled with song that little car-lit parking lot has become. At that point I am hit by an image I will never forget: a flock of birds convening mid-flight, matching their speed, sharing their direction, and always changing, rearranging: a leader becoming a follower. A follower becoming a leader.

I whisper to Cindy, "talk to him. Tell him. Tell him you'll be leaving either way".

But Cindy knows her brother better. She walks over to him and takes his hand. Suddenly they seem to me like they were when I first met them, these two kids from the country, holding each other’s hand in this big city. 

Barry is looking at the people in the clearing and nodding, as if to an unheard beat.

"Yes, yes," he says, maybe to his sister and maybe to himself. "Any why the hell not?"

He walks towards the middle of the parking lot, where paint and brushes are waiting.

# Side 2: Tim

## Track 5: Morning, Gorgeous

I first fell in love with Alice at the sunrise after we decided to follow The Midnight Engine. Sometimes an early sun would catch my eye just right and I would instantly see it again, how she was asleep in the back seat of Barry’s old car, how her head was slumped on the window with her big patches of freckles on that very white skin — how her fingers and hair were dipped in radiant pink. Barry has been driving right behind the band’s van, and every now and then Eddie would pop his head out of the window and shout something back, something like, *we stop for gas in a mile or two*. We’ve been driving all night, at first so excited we talked in hushed, urgent voices, like we were sharing a secret. Everybody was congratulating or joshing Barry about his newfound freedom. It took a long time for the girls to fall asleep. Now it was just me and Barry, my hand hanging on the seat behind him, taking in the view. Then I looked back and I saw Alice, all freckles and paint, and a pain I never felt before went coursing through my veins. I thought, *I’ve never seen anything so pretty*. I thought, *I’ve never been happier*. I thought, *I’ve never been quite so miserable*. 

Around us were cars driven by fellow fans, sometimes overtaking, sometimes slowing down. Every now and then Kimberly’s car, its doors painted with red hearts, would drive by us, and she would lean out of the window and blow kisses at us. Lots of other drivers of those painted cars would signal and wave as they passed, but Kimberly sent kisses. 

Our car had its own ornament, right there ahead of us, taking up all of the space on the hood. Barry painted it and Alice gave the finishing touches. 

At first he was

“The thing is,” I say, stumbling over the words, “the thing is I like red nail polish. It… it attracts my attention. And the thing is that Jo always has her fingernails in red. And ever since the first show, back at the county fair, I used to watch her fingernails. I was transfixed. I’d see nothing but them. I’d hear the music, like, on another track in my head, and my councious brain was all in those fingernails runnin on the neck of that guitar. I’d see them in my dreams. And in my waking hours I would memorize them. Those patterns of shapes they take when the music sounds like this, like *that*. So when I picked up your guitar I knew: *this* shape means *this sound*.” I pluck to illustrate my point. 
	“That’s a G-Major,” Jo says softly. 
	“I don’t know from that,” I say. “I know what it sounds like.”
	“Boy,” says Jo. “Never seen a face so red.”
	“Fine,” I say. “Mock me, whatever. But this is how I know.”
	“You sure you ain’t sick? You wanna have a lie down?”

“You got it all wrong, *Winford,* says Vilma. 
	“Don’t call me that,” says Johnny.
