# The Business of Sound: Record Companies in the 1950s

The 1950s marked a pivotal transformation in the music business, completing the shift from sheet music to physical records as the primary commodity. This environment was characterized by intense competition between established "Major" labels and scrappy "Independent" labels, both vying for control of the lucrative youth market powered by post-war economic prosperity.

## I. Record Company Operations and Structure

The industry was structurally divided, which dictated its operational practices:

1. **The Majors (Big Five):** Companies like RCA Victor, Columbia, Decca, Capitol, and Mercury possessed vast financial resources, professional studios, and established, nationwide distribution networks. Their primary focus was maintaining high sales volumes and appealing to the broadest, often segregated, mainstream pop audience. Their size often made them slow to adopt new, radical sounds like Rhythm and Blues (R&B).
    
2. **The Independents (Indies):** Labels like Sun (Memphis), Chess (Chicago), and Atlantic (New York) were smaller, more innovative, and specialized in niche genres overlooked by the Majors, particularly R&B and Country, which blended to form Rock 'n' Roll. Their financial constraints forced creative production techniques (e.g., the "Chess sound") and gave artists greater artistic freedom.
    

The development of new formats was also key to their operation: the **45 rpm single** became the standard for popular radio airplay and jukeboxes, promoting short, high-energy tracks, while the **33 1/3 rpm LP (album)** was introduced for longer classical, jazz, and eventually, pop recordings.

## II. Offerings and Influence on Young Musicians

Record companies served as both launching pads and gatekeepers for young talent:

- **Financial and Technical Resources:** The primary offer was the ability to record, manufacture, and distribute records nationally (or internationally). This included covering expensive studio time and paying the artist a royalty—a percentage of income from record sales.
    
- **A&R and Image:** The Artist & Repertoire (A&R) departments scouted new talent and often worked hands-on to shape the artist's image and sound. Sam Phillips at Sun Records, for example, famously helped shape Elvis Presley's rockabilly sound.
    
- **The Independent Path:** For artists like Chuck Berry or Elvis Presley, the Indies provided the essential platform. Independent labels were often the only viable medium for marginalized African-American artists at the time.

### **The Influence to Change Music (The Cross-Over)**

Record companies actively influenced artists to maximize commercial appeal, often by softening or changing the music's raw edge to achieve "cross-over" success into the white Pop charts:

- **Racial and Genre Smoothing:** When a raw R&B song by a Black artist became a regional hit, Major labels often had a white artist record a cleaner, more radio-friendly _cover version_ of the song. Pat Boone's covers of Little Richard's songs are a famous example. This practice diluted the original artist's sound and ensured the label captured the immense white teenage market.
    
- **The Teenage Idol:** The massive success of Elvis Presley showed Majors the potential of the "teenage idol"—a marketable star whose image could be promoted across multiple media (radio, film, magazines). Labels began prioritizing singers with the right visual appeal and mass-market musical material over raw musical innovation.
    
- **Format Constraints:** The dominance of the 45 rpm single encouraged songs to be under three minutes and tailored for heavy rotation on Top 40 radio, influencing the structure and length of rock and pop music.
    

## III. Commercialization and Corporate Promotion

Commercialization in the 1950s was aggressive and often ethically dubious, focused on tying music consumption directly to advertising and media.

- **Media Synergy:** Record sales were directly tied to radio and the burgeoning power of television. Record companies engaged in massive promotional campaigns and exploited the "star system" to ensure financial returns.
    
- **Payola:** The most notorious commercial practice was **payola**, the illegal bribing of radio disc jockeys (DJs) to play specific records. This ensured that a label's records became hits, regardless of actual public demand, leading to major government investigations by the end of the decade.
    
- **Corporate Tie-ins (Cigarettes):** Yes, record companies and the musicians they promoted cooperated extensively with major corporations, especially the tobacco industry, for product promotion. While this was common across all media (TV, radio), music and musicians were key advertising vehicles.
    
    - Popular singers and bands, including many whose records were sold by the Major labels (like Bing Crosby, Jo Stafford, and Frank Sinatra), frequently appeared on radio programs sponsored by major cigarette brands (e.g., _Lucky Strike_ and _Chesterfield_).
        
    - The use of singers was a specific marketing tactic to reassure the public—especially younger, potential smokers—that cigarettes were **"harmless to the throat and voice."** By using their credibility, singers helped perpetuate the dangerous illusion of a "safe" cigarette, directly commercializing their public trust for tobacco profit.
