Excerpts from "Steam Pillars - a Memoir", By Prof. Eleanore Pupinstone


Who were the Steam Pillars? What were they like? 
​	Every act has its own character. When you attended a B.B. King concert, you would rightly expect the southern hospitality of the gentle giant, who would talk to you between riffs and ask you how you were and encourage you to go ahead and dance, and coo and coddle you with the gentle giantness of Lucille, his electric semi-hollow guitar. At a The Police concert, the band might have been performing on another planet; their music, emotionally stark and shimmering with harmonized dissonance, was a radio transmission from space, washing over their hypnotized crowds like cosmic radiation. 
​	Elvis was a sexy fucktoy you couldn't have for yourself; The Stones, the kids who would smoke and swear and be fun to be next to; Dylan, the outcast kid who sat far away from the bunch at recess and wrote terribly beautiful poetry he would read to you if only you came and sat quietly next to him.
​	The Steam Pillars were the class clown. 
​	You won't hear it in modern day accounts; the holy graveness in which the Flocking is regarded seeps, like radiation, and paints the Pillars themselves in the same holy watercolors. But the Steam Pillars are not the Flocking; they are separate from it and in many ways alien to it; the revolution they begat, accidentally, disowned its parents, disowned their dangerous whimsey, their endless commitment to be up to no good, to stir a ruckus... their infectious laughter. The Steam Pillars were magnetic, to be sure, sexy as hell, indeed, magical and mystical and closer to real magic than any other act has ever gotten; but they were first and foremost, in those school grounds of the very late fifties, the child who had to wait outside of class because he brought in a frog in his coat pocket.

What were the very late Fifties like?
​​	Each era has its own character. The Police's eighties were glitzy, technocratic; Dylan's sixties urgent and hopeful.  
​	The Fifties were pandemonium. 
​	You can't hear it in the songs that lingered to our day, the sweetness in harmony of the Everly Brothers and the sweetness in melody of Bo Diddly, the terrible lollipop sweetness of its all. But if you had the misfortune of living at the time, the musical soundscape would taste to you less of sugar and more of salt: towering waves coming in from all over, screaming into each other, crashing into each other, leaving in their wake a strange, disharmonious polyphony. You would turn on the radio and a crooner from another time, a Pre-War time, would sing an ancient love song in Italian; right after him, some strange kid who never went to music school would turn a guitar amp too loud so it would break, would play a piano as if it was a drum kit if not a machine gun, would sing hoarsely on purpose, would play wrong notes, also sometimes on purpose. 
​	The waves would crash into each other, changing each other's direction: Negro culture penetrated into the safe haven of the suburban home, smuggled stealthily into the altars of white decency by teenaged double agents. Even sex was no longer the dominion of men and woman who've been brought into the secret cult of marriage. Music radio invaded the small town, the university halls, the merchant ships at sea. No matter who you were, some part of the era's soundtrack was jarring to your ears, awful, hateful, either ancient or rebellious, always foreign. It was indeed a time of foreigners. We were foreigners to each other. 
​	
In those tumultuous, jarring, unfunny times, the Pillar's sudden, gargantuan success was nothing to wonder about: we all needed a good laugh.
