# the fantasy we’re selling 
flock as a multi-car caravan. This is what the reader should fantasize about being there himself. 

# what is side 2 “about” (what *kind* of story is it)
- if the first Side was about a one-car, one-day road trip, the second side is about a long, multi-car trip: 
— a caravan
— a youthful summer excursion
— for the band, a different experience: professional life on the road 

# tim’s persective on the flock
- is with different flocks: wonderland, band, a few others
- rides in different cars: barry’s chevy, the band’s van, increasingly on a motorcycle (“I am a one-man flock”)

# chapter 3
- is about Barry’s and Cindy’s first confrontation with the dad

# the purpose of the inserts (“DJ Jonah here…”)
- talk directly to the reader, planting bigger ideas
- give a zoom-out perspective of the flock
- set the atmosphere 

# what the inserts should be 
- just keep to the disc jocky for all 3 sides 

# communication through messages
- left on public restroom 
- it’s a code shared by flockers which outsiders might not understand
- sometimes it’s love songs
- sometimes it’s just “the flock was here” (killroy) (doodle of two birds?) 
- the word flock comes from one of those 

# changes to the flock during the side
- a few people who mostly need to communicate to keep travelling together - develops mechnisms to communicate, which include a common language, mostly around cars, transportation and shared movement 
- grows and needs to feed, protect and regulate itself - develops mechanisms to work, which includes common ceremonies
- becoms a threat and needs to defend itself from the outside world — develops compassion and empathy for others and learns to negotiate and compromise. 

# people trying to be pazamniks
- we want to show it: the band and “you weren’t in the coal woodshed” ; fans and “we joined on the second show”
- at some point they decide the age of any flocker is zero because you decide to flock every morning 

# dj jonah should be more interesting
- one of the first to report on the flock
- towards the end he’s anti-flock
- his insert always talk about what just happened or what’s about to happen. He’s a prophet.
- he’s commercial, part of the system, he’s cool because he’s playing the part of cool 

# sponsership by Buzz Cigarettes
- at some point, buzz tries to take sponsership over the phenomon, part of Barry’s dad to reconcile with him

# todos
- chapter 2 should have more diagestic music and sounds
