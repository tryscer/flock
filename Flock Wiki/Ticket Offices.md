For a 1958 setting, “ticket offices” for music shows are literal glass-window box offices at the venue (e.g., Richmond’s Mosque: “Tickets will be on sale at the Mosque boxoffice,” _Richmond News Leader_, Mar. 10, 1958: [link](https://www.virginiachronicle.com/?a=d&d=RNL19580310.1.32)), with advance sales scattered across everyday storefronts—record or campus shops ([Pete Seeger OSU ads listing the Union Ticket Booth, Turntable Record Shop, Betty’s Co-ed Shop, _The Lantern_, May 14–15, 1958: 1) [link](https://osupublicationarchives.osu.edu/?a=d&d=LTN19580514-01.2.51.1) 2) [link](https://osupublicationarchives.osu.edu/?a=d&d=LTN19580515-01.2.46.3)], another ad: “Advance tickets on sale at State Record Shop…,” _MSU State News_, Oct. 7, 1958: [pdf](https://sanweb.lib.msu.edu/DMC/state_news/1958/state_news_19581007.pdf)), drugstores and travel bureaus (North Canton notice: “Tickets on sale at Mack’s Drugstore… in Massillon at AAA World Wide Travel Bureau,” _The Sun_, Mar. 26, 1958: [link](https://ohiomemory.org/digital/collection/p16007coll23/id/17616/)), hotel lobby agencies (Ross & Babcock Travel Bureau in the Claypool Hotel lobby, _Indianapolis Recorder_, Apr. 12, 1958 & Nov. 22, 1958: 1) [link](https://newspapers.library.in.gov/?a=d&d=INR19580412-01.1.12) 2) [link](https://newspapers.library.in.gov/?a=d&d=INR19581122-01.1.12)), and central ticket agencies (_Baltimore Afro-American_, May 3, 1958: [pdf](https://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/ecpdata/webroot/msaref14/msa_sc5458_000045_000250/pdf/msa_afro_1958_01_bc_late_edition-0249.pdf)); phone orders often use two-letter exchanges—see “SC 3-1223” (_Scarsdale Inquirer_, Jul. 25, 1958: [link](https://news.hrvh.org/veridian/?a=d&d=scarsdaleinquire19580725.1.10)) or “PL 1-6498” (_The Jewish Herald_, 1958: [pdf](https://www.rijha.org/wp-content/uploads/voiceandherald/volumes-1958/The%20Jewish%20Herald%20-%2003.07.1958.pdf)). Computerized networks are still years away—Ticketron’s service launches late-1960s (history: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticketron); research overview: [Music Business Research](https://musicbusinessresearch.wordpress.com/2011/09/09/ticket-masters-part-1-the-emergence-of-electronic-ticketing-services/)) and Ticketmaster is founded in 1976 ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticketmaster)). In Jim Crow Virginia, seating and even entrances/windows were segregated by law—the Public Assemblages Act (1926) required separation at public halls and theaters ([Encyclopedia Virginia – primary text](https://encyclopediavirginia.org/primary-documents/separation-of-races-1926/); context: [Racial Integrity Laws timeline](https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/racial-integrity-laws-1924-1930/); public accommodations remained segregated until the Civil Rights Act of 1964: [Virginia Museum of History & Culture](https://virginiahistory.org/learn/civil-rights-movement-virginia/equal-access-public-accommodations)), which matches what you’d see at mainstream 1958 package tours at The Mosque (e.g., Alan Freed’s _Biggest Show of Stars_ with Sam Cooke there on Apr. 6, 1958: [tour log](https://rnrhistorian.blogspot.com/2017/05/biggest-show-of-stars-1958-spring.html); [contemporary note on prices $1.50–$2.50](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156926227732401&id=68330842400&set=a.276592087400)); for period-true copy, mimic newspaper style like “Tickets $1.95—on sale at [Record Shop], Ross & Babcock Travel Bureau (Claypool Hotel lobby), or at the Auditorium Box Office; mail orders filled” (examples with prices and outlets in 1958 ads: [Indianapolis Recorder](https://newspapers.library.in.gov/?a=d&d=INR19581122-01.1.12), [MSU State News](https://sanweb.lib.msu.edu/DMC/state_news/1958/state_news_19581007.pdf)).
