## 1) What the phenomenon is called
**“Love.”** That’s what the fans call the whole thing:
- they **love** the band
- they describe the music as the band’s **love given to the crowd**
- they describe the post-show softness—with each other and with the world—as **love**

> **Writer rule:** characters don’t say “high,” “drug,” “psychedelic,” “MDMA,” “trance,” etc. They say **Love**.

## 2) Hard rules (never explained in-text, but must stay consistent)

### 2.1 Live-only
The effect **only happens at a live show**. Any recording is **dead**.

### 2.2 Participation is required (and chosen)
To feel Love, you must be a **participator**:
- you must be **in the crowd, dancing**
- touch is **implied** as part of dancing in that crowd (hands, shoulders, bodies in proximity), but **hands-only** becomes formalized later by Babatunde’s protocol
- it is **always a choice**: anyone can sit it out, watch, or leave

> **Writer rule:** spectators can observe the crowd; they don’t feel Love. Participators do.

### 2.3 Universality (baseline effects)
- **Everyone who participates** experiences:
  - automatic / compelled dancing
  - post-show softness + alertness
- **Only some** participants experience visions.

### 2.4 No cumulative effects
No tolerance, no craving arc, no “each show changes you chemically.”  
**Each show stands alone** (even if the social consequences accumulate).

### 2.5 The crowd is gentle
Movements are **non-violent**. The field feels **amazing**, inviting, hard to step away from once you’re in—but never framed as coercion. It’s seduction by belonging.

## 3) The three phases of Love (the repeatable pattern)

### Phase A: During the show — “the body takes the wheel”
**Core output:** compelled dancing + (for some) brief communal vision-symbols.

#### A1) Onset cues (pick 1–2 per show)
- flutter (signature tell)
- breath shifts (a sudden need to inhale)
- skin wakes up (fabric becomes loud, sweat arrives early)
- the air thickens (heat, pressure)
- time dilation (a beat becomes a corridor)
- micro-sway begins before intention

#### A2) Compelled dancing (automatic movement)
Write it as **agency sliding**:
- “I” → “my knees / feet / hips” as the subject
- movement feels *corrective*, like rhythm is aligning the body
- spectators become participators by stepping in and joining the dance

**Crowd metaphors (1958-safe):**
- congregation rising
- an engine finding timing (pistons, dynamos)
- a cornfield under wind
- a school of fish turning as one

#### A3) Visions (only for some; communal symbols)
**Vision rules:**
- visions are **communal** (same symbolic vocabulary for everyone who gets them)
- interpretation is **personal** (lens of personality)
- they occur during **intense musical passages**:
  - intricate rhythms
  - very loud sections
  - heat
  - high crowd density

**Symbol image bank (always the same family):**
- **birds** (especially in coordinated motion)
- **flocks of birds**
- **railroad engines** (weight, momentum, iron breath)
- **cloud pillars**
- **pillars of steam** (vertical force, beckoning)

**How to render visions (no lore dumps):**
- brief, vivid flashes
- more “meaningful pattern” than fantasy
- often followed by social confirmation (“Did you see it?” / “What did you see?”)

> **Writer rule:** no encyclopedic prophecy. One symbol. One emotional punch.

#### A4) Emotional tone at peak
- awe + surrender
- tenderness toward strangers
- a clean, frightening sense of *bigness* (something larger than the self)

---

### Phase B: Night after — “warmth that won’t sleep”
**Core output:** prosocial closeness + wakefulness.

#### B1) Prosocial tenderness (“Love” as social glue)
Shows up as:
- easy honesty (confessions without melodrama)
- permissioned touch (hands, shoulders, leaning, hugging)
- laughter as relief
- tears without shame

**Sexuality note (guardrail):**  
There can be sex, but it stems from **intimacy and closeness**, not a cartoon libido spike. It reads as *tender, human, situational*, not druggy.

#### B2) Wakefulness
- people stay awake late, talking like the night is a room they can’t leave
- bodies are tired but minds are bright
- an inner “hum” (metaphorical) persists after the music ends

#### B3) Costs (keep it believable)
Include **one small consequence beat per show-night**:
- sore feet, dehydration, headaches
- oversharing aftermath
- occasional irritability or sudden sadness in a minority

---

### Phase C: Day after — “soft world, clean energy”
**Core output:** energized softness, cooperative readiness (flocking becomes plausible).

Shows up as:
- early, clean energy (not frantic)
- the world feels less hostile; edges softened
- chores and logistics feel meaningful
- moral clarity that is beautiful *and* slightly dangerous (certainty spreads)

**Keep one grain of sand** (to avoid wellness vibes):
- a bruise (literal/emotional)
- a doubt about what was real
- an echo-craving for belonging (social, not chemical)

---

## 4) The recording rupture (“the single kills the magic”)
When the Steam Pillars record a single, the flock experiences it as **the Love disappearing**. Keep the in-world explanation **ambiguous**:

**What characters say:**
- Babatunde: recording **“steals the soul out of the music.”**
- Fans: the band **commercialized** / “sold out.”

**What’s true behind the scenes (writer-only):**
- the band and the crowd **fell out of Love** with each other.

> **Writer rule:** the single isn’t a “science reason.” It’s a relational/spiritual rupture expressed through the Love framework.

---

## 5) Babatunde’s “enough” protocol (keeping flocking alive)
Babatunde teaches *one aspect* of Love—**enough** to keep flocking going even when the band’s Love falters.

### 5.1 The protocol (simple, repeatable, portable)
- dance to **any live music**
- keep **hands touching**—and **only the hands**  
  (hands become the approved conduit; the discipline matters)

### 5.2 Requirements
- you need **someone making live music**
- you need **someone dancing to it** (a participating crowd is ideal)

### 5.3 What it preserves
- synchrony (the flock feeling)
- tenderness/softness
- cooperative energy

### 5.4 What it does *not* promise
- it is not “the Steam Pillars show, anywhere, anytime”
- it’s “enough” — a sustaining ritual, not the original miracle

> **Writer rule:** Babatunde frames it as *practice*, not magic. The flock can keep Love alive by doing Love.

---

## 6) Scene checklist (for drafting any show sequence)
Every Steam Pillars show you write should include:
- 1 onset cue (flutter/breath/heat/time shift)
- 1 compelled-dancing beat (agency sliding to the body)
- 1 crowd-as-organism image
- if visions occur: 1 symbol from the image bank + 1 social confirmation line
- 1 night-after or day-after echo beat somewhere in the chapter (wakefulness / softness)

This is how you teach the rules without exposition.
