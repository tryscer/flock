## Notable places in the neighborhood

### Poe Museum

Edgar Allan Poe Museum in Shockoe Bottom was open before 1958. It was founded and opened to the public in 1922. It is a few hundred meters from the main street train station
#### **Popular Culture and Public Image**

Beyond the classroom, Poe had a strong presence in **1950s popular culture**. His reputation as a dark, troubled, and mysterious figure—often portrayed as a "mad genius"—appealed to youth culture. His work was frequently adapted for radio shows and, later, for television anthology series, which made his stories accessible to a broader audience.

**Alfred Hitchcock Presents:** Although Alfred Hitchcock himself only directed a few episodes, this iconic series, which began in 1955, frequently featured suspenseful and often macabre stories that aligned with Poe's themes. While not all episodes were direct adaptations of Poe, the overall tone and many storylines would have resonated with his work.

### 9th St Bridge (on the way from Main St Station to Greensboro)

From the bridge you can see the Main St Station Clock tower
While a specific traffic report from that day is not available, we can piece together a likely scenario based on what we know about the old Ninth Street Bridge and the era.

The bridge was a narrow, two-lane structure with a wooden deck and no lane separation. A Saturday late afternoon in June would have been a high-traffic period, with people coming and going from downtown, running errands, or heading out for the evening.

Given the bridge's narrow design and the lack of modern traffic management, it would have been a bottleneck. It's highly probable that traffic would have been slow-moving and congested, with cars potentially backed up on both sides as they waited to cross. The sound of tires on the wooden deck and metal strips would have been a constant backdrop to the stop-and-go traffic.
#### Arriving on the bridge:
it is very likely there would have been a sign directing you to U.S. Route 60 from Main Street, so its only one left turn from the train station

## Events effecting in 1958

The construction of the Richmond-Petersburg Turnpike (soon to be I-95) cut a devastating, block-wide swath through the area, physically severing communities and casting a new, concrete shadow over historic landmarks like Main Street Station.

On June 14, 1958, a significant event in the history of Shockoe Bottom, Richmond, Virginia, was the completion of the city's first wastewater treatment plant. Located on the southern bank of the James River, this plant was built to process sewage before it was discharged into the river.



## Description bits

By night, the neighborhood's character was likely defined by a quiet darkness, as its once-bustling social life had largely migrated to adjacent, culturally vibrant neighborhoods like Jackson Ward, leaving behind an industrial district in decline.
