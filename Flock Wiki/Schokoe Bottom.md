## Notable places in the neighborhood

### Poe Museum

Edgar Allan Poe Museum in Shockoe Bottom was open before 1958. It was founded and opened to the public in 1922. It is a few hundred meters from the main street train station
#### **Popular Culture and Public Image**

Beyond the classroom, Poe had a strong presence in **1950s popular culture**. His reputation as a dark, troubled, and mysterious figure—often portrayed as a "mad genius"—appealed to youth culture. His work was frequently adapted for radio shows and, later, for television anthology series, which made his stories accessible to a broader audience.

**Alfred Hitchcock Presents:** Although Alfred Hitchcock himself only directed a few episodes, this iconic series, which began in 1955, frequently featured suspenseful and often macabre stories that aligned with Poe's themes. While not all episodes were direct adaptations of Poe, the overall tone and many storylines would have resonated with his work.

The newsstand will be inside the station, in the main waiting area. 

In 1958, the newspaper most likely to include information about music performances in Black neighborhoods would have been the **Richmond Afro-American**.

While mainstream white-owned newspapers like the _Richmond Times-Dispatch_ would have covered general entertainment, their focus would have been on music and venues for a white audience. The _Richmond Afro-American_, on the other hand, was a Black-owned newspaper with a mission to cover the news, culture, and social life of the African-American community. It was a vital source of information on events at places like the Hippodrome Theater and other clubs on "The Deuce" in Jackson Ward.

If you are looking for venues and events for a white audience, the most likely sources would be the mainstream, white-owned daily newspapers in Richmond at that time.

These would be the **Richmond Times-Dispatch** and the **Richmond News Leader**. Their entertainment sections and local event listings would have been the primary place to find information on music halls, theaters, and other venues catering to a white clientele.

### 9th St Bridge (on the way from Main St Station to Greensboro)
![[Pasted image 20250927081714.png]]

From the bridge you can see the Main St Station Clock tower
While a specific traffic report from that day is not available, we can piece together a likely scenario based on what we know about the old Ninth Street Bridge and the era.

The bridge was a narrow, two-lane structure with a wooden deck and ==no lane separation==. A Saturday late afternoon in June would have been a high-traffic period, with people coming and going from downtown, running errands, or heading out for the evening.

Given the bridge's narrow design and the lack of modern traffic management, it would have been a bottleneck. It's highly probable that traffic would have been slow-moving and congested, with cars potentially backed up on both sides as they waited to cross. The sound of tires on the wooden deck and metal strips would have been a constant backdrop to the stop-and-go traffic.
#### Arriving on the bridge:
it is very likely there would have been a sign directing you to U.S. Route 60 from Main Street, so its only one left turn from the train station

### Hippodrome
The Hippodrome Theater is located at **528 North 2nd Street** in Richmond, Virginia, in the Jackson Ward neighborhood, just north of Shockoe Bottom. In 1958, this area was the cultural hub of the city's Black community and a famous destination for music and entertainment.

The theater is known for its beautiful architecture and was a popular venue for vaudeville, movies, and live music.

This video provides historical context about the Hippodrome Theater, which was a landmark on the same street as Scotty's Barber Shop.

###  Scotty's Barber Shop
In 1958, a prominent barber shop in Jackson Ward, Richmond, Virginia, was **Scotty's Barber Shop**. It was located near the Hippodrome Theater on North 2nd Street, a bustling area known as "The Deuce" and the heart of the "Harlem of the South."1

William Lomax, a well-known barber in the community, started his career at Scotty's Barber Shop after graduating from Maggie L. Walker High School in 1949.2 He later took over the shop and continued to cut hair in the Jackson Ward community for over 62 years.

### Navy Hill

One of the Jackson Ward communities decimated by the Richmond-Petersburg Turnpike was Navy Hill, a community formed after the [American Civil War](https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/civil-war-in-virginia-the-american/) (1861–1865) that was initially a mixture of German immigrant and Black residents. The community centered around Navy Hill School, one of two schools built specifically for Blacks students in the early twentieth century.
#### The Early Years

The **Navy Hill** community was situated north of Broad Street and as an extension of Jackson Ward. It had a unique demographic makeup in its early days.1 By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was a working-class neighborhood that evolved from a mixed-race community of German immigrants and free Black residents into a thriving African-American district.2

It was an important residential area for many of the business owners and professionals of Jackson Ward, which was famously known as the "Black Wall Street of America."

#### The Impact of Urban Renewal

The mixed-race and later predominantly Black character of Navy Hill was a major factor in its decline. Throughout the 20th century, city planning decisions in Richmond were often racially biased, leading to the destruction of minority neighborhoods in the name of "urban renewal."4



## Events effecting in 1958

### The construction of the Richmond-Petersburg Turnpike (soon to be I-95)
The R-P TP on the map
![[Pasted image 20250930044235.png]]

The construction cut a devastating, block-wide swath through the area, physically severing communities and casting a new, concrete shadow over historic landmarks like Main Street Station.

In June 1958, "The Deuce" (2nd Street) in Jackson Ward was not the same vibrant, intact community it had been just a few years earlier. The area was already deeply affected by the construction of the Richmond-Petersburg Turnpike, which would officially open just a month later.

Here is what the area would have been like:

- **A Landscape of Demolition:** The construction was well underway. Large, block-wide swaths of the neighborhood had been razed to clear the path for the new highway.1 The vibrant streetscape you would have known would have been replaced in many places by empty lots, rubble, and the scars of demolition.
    
- **A Divided Community:** The construction cut a literal ditch through the heart of Jackson Ward, physically separating it into two halves.2 This broke up the flow of community life and commerce, as many streets were blocked or divided.
    
- **Businesses Already Feeling the Effects:** The destructive process of "urban renewal," which targeted historically Black neighborhoods, had already displaced hundreds of homes and businesses. The vibrant cultural scene was in decline, with many establishments either gone or struggling due to the disruption and the impending finality of the highway.
    

It was a time of immense change and disruption, where the "Harlem of the South" was being dismantled to make way for the future of the American automobile.

### Water Treatment Plant

On June 14, 1958, a significant event in the history of Shockoe Bottom, Richmond, Virginia, was the completion of the city's first wastewater treatment plant. Located on the southern bank of the James River, this plant was built to process sewage before it was discharged into the river.



## Description bits

By night, the neighborhood's character was likely defined by a quiet darkness, as its once-bustling social life had largely migrated to adjacent, culturally vibrant neighborhoods like Jackson Ward, leaving behind an industrial district in decline.

## Historic Background on Richmond and the neighborhood

**In Northern Virginia,** the roots of removal of Black communities in the name of urban redevelopment go back as far as the Great Depression and paved the way for multiple federal agencies to expand their operations by expropriating privately held land from Black communities in the region during and after World War II.

In 1946, the city of **RICHMOND** contracted Harland Bartholomew, an ardent segregationist, to draft a master plan for the city's redevelopment. This plan focused on demolishing Black neighborhoods and repurposing the land for housing and amenities for white residents, as well as for highways. Black residents were displaced to a series of public housing projects that came to define the failure of urban renewal.  [source](https://encyclopediavirginia.org/urbanrenewal/)
