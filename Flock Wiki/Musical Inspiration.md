## Best Known Songs
Here are ~20 of the **most-streamed songs** on Spotify _as of now_ that were released between **1950-1958**. Caveats: “most-streamed” means cumulative plays on Spotify—not necessarily “most played in 2025 only.” Also, seasonal/christmas songs tend to spike in streams every holiday, which can distort “current year” rankings.

* “~X million” are approximate streams as listed on Spotify via Kworb or similar aggregators.  
** These are just outside 1958 (1959) so strictly speaking don't meet your range—but they show up in close-by top lists; I included them for comparison.
