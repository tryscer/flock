Bassist with [[The Steam Pillars]].

**The music he brings: he invents funk by listening to Babatunde.**

**His bass playing**: Mucho is a slap-bass player. His powerful hands on the strings cause the bass to be heard loudly, an effect he later amplifies by turning up his electric bass amp to the overdriven range, making his playing both loud and aggressive-sounding. He’s strong, but also incredibly agile, playing swift filler and ghost notes, making the bassline feel light and the people who hear it feel incredibly motivated to dance. “Making it look easy is the name of the game, baby”. He plays powerful, repetetive lines that dance with Babatunde’s heavy drumming. 
**Voice:** Mucho sings in a very high voice (even though his talking register is extremely low). His vocal range offsets his instrument range. He likes to sing along to his own bass line, creating a harmony between man and machine. 
**Instrument:** an upright bass; later, a 1957 Fender Precision bass. 
The Steam Pillar's bassist, originally plays a standing bass, later to be replaced by an electric one
