Location: Fort McClellan was a large U.S. Army installation located in Anniston, Alabama, which, at the time, was a small city of about 25,000 people. Anniston served as a significant hub for military families and personnel.
1946 Context: The base was a massive training center during World War II. After the war, in 1946, while the military was in a phase of demobilization, Fort McClellan remained a key installation. It was still home to a significant number of officers and a smaller, permanent party of soldiers. The town of Anniston and its surrounding communities were where many of these families lived, creating a vibrant military-civilian community.
Lifestyle: Officers and their families would have a more settled existence in Anniston, living in suburban-style homes and participating in the life of the town, which provided schools, shops, and social events that catered to both the military and local populations.
