מוזיקה רזה מבחינת כלים - קצב , גיטרה חשמלית ובס - כל השאר זה שירה

ההבחנה הברורה בין הלהקה לקהל מתמוססת - אנשים יכולים להצטרף או לצאת

כשיש מבצע - הארגון יותר הדוק, כשיש הופעה יש לכאורה יותר מקום לחופש - מי עולה ומי נמצא, אבל למעשה יש גם כאן ארגון, יש מי שיודע מה עובד

בחזרות הלהקה עובדת על אילתורים מסבביב לנושא מוזיקלי עד שכל נגן יודע איך הכלי שלו פועל בתוך התמה, ויכול לאלתר בהופעה על בסיס זה

בדומה לדיג'י בהופעות - קוראים את הקהל, מחליטים לאן רוצים לקחת אותו, ובונים מסלול מוזיקלי שיביא לשם.
> לדוגמא המהלך בהופעת ערב פרק 4 - מאחדים את הקהל באבל סביב מותו של אלוויס,  ולוקחים אותם משם להתרוממות רוח וחוויה מוזיקלית משותפת


בלהקה יש 5 נגנים קבועים, ויש עד 10  קונדקטורים - חלקם יודעים לשיר ולנגן  ולהצטרף באופן אורגני

הקנוניה נתמכת ע"י ארגון חשאי שאמנם יכול לממן אותה, אבל לא שופך ברוחב לב. חברי המחתרת חיים בצניעות, מסתפקים במועט, חיים למען מטרה. רכישה צריכה להיות מוצדקת בראיית המטרה

המוזיקה חייבת להיות חיה - לאמוקלטת - כי היא נוצרת עם הקהל. באמת שאי אפשר ליצור ולשמוע את המוזיקה הזו בלי להשתתף בה
היצירה היא לא רק מוזיקה היא גם ריקוד
No spectators

הלהקה יכולה גם לאמץ מה שבא מתוך הקהל -למשל כשהרברנד מסתובב בקהל ושר Nobody's fault by mine
כשכל פעם מישהו חוזר אחריו - אז אלים אומרתIt was nobody's fault
והרברנד מאמץ את זה וזו הופכת להיות הקריאה החדשה





Some inputs from Gemini:

In the late 1950s, the musical genre that could evoke a euphoric state similar to MDMA was **Rock and Roll**, particularly in its raw, unfiltered form as seen in the work of artists like Little Richard and Jerry Lee Lewis. This was a direct result of a fusion of African American musical traditions, specifically **Gospel music** and **Rhythm and Blues (R&B)**, with a more European-influenced country sound.

This music didn't rely on technology like modern synthesizers but on the sheer energy and raw power of its instruments and performance.

### The Instruments and Their Sound

* **Electric Guitar**: This was the centerpiece, and its sound was revolutionary. It wasn't the clean, polished sound of jazz or pop. It was often raw and slightly overdriven, created by tube amplifiers pushed to their limits. A solid-body electric guitar (like a Fender Telecaster or Gibson Les Paul) could produce a sustained, buzzing tone, and the guitarists, like Chuck Berry, used it to create powerful, memorable riffs and solos. The **whammy bar**, though new, was also used to bend notes and create a feeling of unhinged excitement.
* **Acoustic Upright Bass**: While electric bass guitars were emerging, the upright bass was still common. Its deep, percussive "slap" on the beat (a technique borrowed from rockabilly) provided a physical, driving rhythm that you could feel in your chest.
* **Drum Kit**: The drums were the backbone. The **beat was a strong, steady pulse**, often with a heavy backbeat on beats 2 and 4, which had a powerful entraining effect. The energy of the drumming was often frantic and energetic, driving the song forward.
* **Piano or Saxophone**: In many early rock and roll songs, the piano or saxophone acted as the lead instrument, particularly in the style of **boogie-woogie** or **jump blues**. The piano playing was often fast-paced and percussive, with a driving left-hand rhythm. The saxophone would provide wailing, high-energy solos.

### The Vocals and Harmony

* **Raw, Passionate Vocals**: Vocals were not smooth or gentle. They were often delivered with a sense of emotional abandon, almost a "shout." This style was directly influenced by **Gospel music**, where singers would push their voices to the limits to express spiritual ecstasy and conviction. Artists like Little Richard used powerful shouts, falsetto shrieks, and whoops that conveyed an almost manic energy and euphoria. This wasn't just singing; it was a physical and spiritual release.
* **Call-and-Response**: A common technique borrowed from gospel and blues was a **call-and-response** between the lead vocalist and backing singers or instruments. This created a feeling of community and shared experience, as if the music was a conversation that everyone was participating in.
* **Simple, but Emotionally Potent Harmony**: The harmonies were generally straightforward, based on the **12-bar blues progression** (I-IV-V chords), which was a familiar and emotionally resonant structure. The predictability of the harmony allowed the listeners to anticipate the musical changes, and the fulfillment of that anticipation would create a feeling of release and satisfaction.

### The Genre Influence

This music borrowed heavily from three main influences to create its euphoric effect:

* **Gospel Music**: The most significant influence. Rock and roll took the emotional fervor, spiritual intensity, and physical expressiveness of a Pentecostal church service and placed it in a secular context. The music was designed to induce a state of physical and emotional possession, much like a spiritual trance.
* **Rhythm and Blues (R&B)**: This genre contributed the strong, danceable beat, the use of powerful electric instruments, and the "shouted" vocal style. R&B was already a high-energy, exciting form of music, and rock and roll simply amplified its most potent elements.
* **Country and Western**: Country music brought the influence of acoustic instruments and storytelling, but its "hillbilly boogie" subgenre contributed the driving rhythms and electric guitar picking styles that were foundational to rockabilly and early rock and roll.

In summary, the music wasn't about technology; it was about the primal fusion of rhythm, passion, and raw sound. It was the sound of ecstatic release, a secular celebration of the same physical and emotional rapture found in the church, and for many young people, it was a brand-new way to feel completely and physically alive.


The entraining effect is a phenomenon where the internal rhythms of a system, such as a person's body or brain, synchronize with a strong, external rhythm. It is the process of **rhythmic synchronization** between two independent oscillating systems.

### How It Works in Music 🎶

In music, entrainment most commonly describes how our biological rhythms, like our heart rate, brainwaves, and physical movements, lock onto the rhythm and tempo of a song.

* **Heartbeat**: A fast-paced song with a tempo of 120 beats per minute (bpm) can cause a listener's heart rate to increase and match or come close to that tempo, leading to feelings of excitement and energy. Conversely, a slow, calming song at 60 bpm can lower the heart rate and induce relaxation.
* **Movement**: This effect is why people involuntarily tap their feet, nod their heads, or start dancing when they hear a catchy beat. The rhythmic patterns of the music activate motor networks in the brain, prompting physical movement in sync with the beat. 
* **Brainwaves**: The most profound form of entrainment is **neural entrainment**, where brainwaves—the rhythmic electrical activity in the brain—begin to align with the frequency of a musical stimulus. For instance, listening to a repetitive, low-frequency beat can cause brain activity to shift toward slower alpha or theta waves, which are associated with states of deep relaxation and meditation.

### The Underlying Mechanism 🧠

The entraining effect is not a simple one-way street; it's a dynamic interaction. Our brain uses the rhythmic cues in music to create an internal representation of the beat, and our body and mind then adjust to follow it. This process is believed to be rooted in our brain's auditory and motor systems, which are closely linked, allowing us to process and respond to rhythmic patterns almost automatically. This ability is thought to have an evolutionary basis, as rhythmic entrainment can facilitate social bonding and coordinated group activities, such as dancing or marching.
