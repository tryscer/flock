## Musicality
They are a supergroup of excellent musicians who play well together. They make instantly engaging, powerful music that brings the crowd to an extatic phase. They are so powerful thousands decide to follow them around. 

They blend several musical styles and voices to create an effect on the crowd:
- Vilma’s smooth voice is personal and emotive, pleasent to hear; that causes a lure and an emotional connection; 
- Jo’s distorted guitar is a contrast to Vilma’s voice, shocking and exciting; 
- Heath Walker Cain’s piano playing is fun, quick, very rythmic, and at times jarring and exciting like Jo’s guitar. When he sings, his singing will be acidic and raspy, a contrast to Vilma’s voice;
- Babatunde’s drumming syncs the crowd’s breathing and heartbeats and creates a feeling of togetherness;
- Besame Mucho’s bass playing (loud, intricate) creates a music that, in combination with Babatunde’s drumming, is impossible not to move to;
- The men’s choir (Johnny Bass, Mucho high Alto, Heath high baritone, Mucho bass baritone) are a powerful call-and-response dynamic in the music which sways to crowd to sing along. 

Personally they think of themselves as pupeteers: controlling the crowd through their playing. They’re not here to make art, or money: they want to see the crowd moving together. “It’s all about the dancing.”

They prefer to cover old standards in their own interpretation, rather than write new ones. Indicates music’s ability to be shared and collaborated on.
