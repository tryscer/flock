The second performance of the Midnight Engine takes place in a tobacco warehouse in Shockoe Bottom
In 1958, Shockoe Bottom in Richmond, Virginia, was a district with a complex and layered history, existing in a state of transition and a mix of decline and gritty vitality. It was a far cry from the revitalized and gentrified entertainment district it is today.
Here's a description of what it was like:
A Historic Hub of Commerce and Industry: Shockoe Bottom was one of Richmond's oldest neighborhoods, situated on the banks of the James River and Shockoe Creek.1 It was the historical heart of the city's commerce, built on its tobacco trade, shipping, and flour mills.2 By 1958, many of these industries were in decline, but the area was still an active commercial and industrial zone, filled with warehouses, railroad tracks, and factories. The air would have smelled of tobacco, coffee, and river dampness.
The Shockoe Valley Project: The city of Richmond had ambitious plans for urban renewal in the area, which would later be known as the Shockoe Valley Project. In 1958, this was a project in its earliest stages, but it created an atmosphere of uncertainty. Many of the old, historic buildings were seen as "slums" to be cleared for new development, leading to neglect and a sense of decay in parts of the neighborhood.
A Hub for the Black Community (and Segregation): Shockoe Bottom had a long and painful history as a major slave-trading center.3 By 1958, it was a a vibrant, but still segregated, area with a thriving Black business community. It would have had its own small businesses, stores, and juke joints that served the local Black population. However, it was also where the city's poorest residents lived, and it was a district that was often overlooked by the city's white elite.
A "Gritty" and Diverse Scene: The area was a crossroads of different social classes. You would find merchants, factory workers, railroad employees, and people from all walks of life. The streets would be a mix of old cobblestones and worn-out asphalt. It would be a noisy, bustling, and somewhat chaotic area, with the constant presence of trains and the hustle of commerce.
In essence, Shockoe Bottom in 1958 was a neighborhood in transition, filled with a sense of historical weight and a gritty, working-class vitality, but also with a looming sense of decay and the promise of a future that would erase its past.

At night, Shockoe Bottom in 1958 transformed. The din of daytime commerce faded, replaced by the deep, rhythmic sounds of the neighborhood's nocturnal life. The air, heavy with the scent of spilled coffee beans and river dampness, carried the lonely wail of a train's whistle echoing through the valley. Streets, a mix of worn asphalt and old cobblestone, were pools of deep shadow punctuated by the dim glow of streetlights. In the segregated Black business district, neon signs from small storefronts and juke joints cast vibrant, inviting splashes of red and blue onto the sidewalks. The muffled, soulful sounds of blues and R&B spilled from these doors, creating a warm, pulsing contrast to the cool silence of the empty warehouses. It was a place of secrets, a gritty, vital, and sometimes dangerous world that came alive after dark.

The train station to New York, where they are supposed to be dropping Puppy off

In 1958, the primary train station with service to New York from Richmond was Main Street Station. It was located directly in the eastern part of the Shockoe Bottom neighborhood.
The station was a major hub for several passenger railroads, including the Richmond, Fredericksburg & Potomac Railroad and the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, which connected travelers to the Northeast Corridor and onward to New York City's Penn Station. Its location in the heart of Shockoe Bottom meant that the sights, sounds, and smells of the neighborhood—with its factories, warehouses, and bustling streets—were the first and last impressions a traveler would have of the city.
A deserted tobacco warehouse that could be used for a concert would be most plausibly located in the industrial and commercial areas of Shockoe Bottom, particularly along the railroad tracks and near the James River.
In 1958, this part of the neighborhood was in a state of transition, with many of the old, historic warehouses and factories either in decline or awaiting demolition as part of the planned urban renewal projects. These old, multi-story brick structures, with their large, open interiors and high ceilings, would have been ideal for a covert concert.
The location would have been:
Near the railroad tracks: This would have been the historical lifeblood of the neighborhood's commerce, and the warehouses were built there for easy access to rail transport. The presence of the tracks would also provide a plausible reason for the noise of a concert to be masked by the sounds of passing trains.
A "Gritty" and Disused Area: The warehouses would be located in a part of the neighborhood that was no longer a major commercial hub, a place where people would not typically go at night. This would provide the perfect cover for an "underground" event.
A Building Awaiting Demolition: It's plausible that a specific warehouse had been bought by a development company for a future project and was sitting empty, providing an opportunistic and temporary venue for a band to play in secret.

The outside of the tobacco warehouse
The outside of such a building would be a monument to industrial decay. It's a looming, multi-story structure of dark red or brown brick, weathered by decades of neglect and soot. The mortar between the bricks is crumbling, and in some places, chunks of brick have fallen away, revealing a dark skeleton beneath. The windows are its most telling feature—some are boarded up with rotting wood, while others are shattered, leaving jagged teeth of glass that glint in the weak light. The remaining panes are grimy and opaque, and the dust-covered interiors are barely visible through them.
Identical buildings on either side press in, creating a narrow, canyon-like lane. The alley itself is paved with cobblestones, slick with rain and oil, and littered with industrial debris: rusted metal barrels, splintered pallets, and discarded machinery. The air in the lane is heavy and smells of damp earth and disuse. Overhead, fire escapes zig-zag down the facades, their metal railings rusted and some of their steps missing. In the absence of sunlight, the lane is permanently shrouded in a deep shadow, making it feel like a forgotten world. The only sounds are the echoes of your own footsteps and the distant wail of a train, a constant reminder of the neighborhood's past life.
Getting Inside the warehouse
The narrow, cobblestone lane leads to a single, steel-reinforced side door. It's an old, heavy door, and when it creaks open, a different kind of darkness spills out, a cool, musty air that smells of concrete and old wood. Inside, a single, bare bulb hangs from a frayed wire, casting a weak, yellow light on a set of steep, wooden stairs that descend into a vast, cavernous space. The stairs are worn, with a loose plank or two, and they groan with every step.
At the bottom of the stairs, the space opens up into a scene of industrial decay. The main floor is a massive expanse of cracked concrete, and the high ceilings are lost in shadow. Above, a network of heavy-duty loading cranes, their rusted chains dangling uselessly, hang from massive steel girders. The cranes are still on their tracks, but the motors are long gone, and the whole system is a ghostly relic of the building's working life. Near the walls, old, bulky tobacco presses stand like silent sentinels, their heavy iron gears and levers caked in a thick layer of dust. The air is still, but if you look closely, you can see dust motes dancing in the shafts of light that pierce the darkness from the bare bulbs. The walls themselves are of thick, exposed brick, but they're not a clean red. They're coated in a dark, sticky patina of decades of tobacco dust and grime, stained with the ghost of the building's purpose. The entire space is a monument to its past, a world of machines and heavy labor, now silent and waiting for a new life.

To create a space inside the warehouse that is both intimate and has a mechanical contraption for the show, you can use the original function of the space as a dramatic backdrop. A compelling and plausible option would be the old tobacco grading or processing room.
Original Function and Layout
Tobacco Grading and Processing: Before being baled, tobacco leaves were sorted and graded by quality. This work often took place in a smaller, enclosed room that needed to be well-lit (via windows or skylights) and away from the dust and grime of the main warehouse floor. These rooms were often part of the main structure but were partitioned off by walls.
The Mechanical Contraption: For the purpose of handling the heavy leaves and bales, these rooms often had some form of internal mechanical equipment. Instead of a massive bridge crane (which wouldn't fit), a more plausible and dramatic piece of equipment would be a manual or small electric chain hoist suspended from a sturdy, horizontal steel I-beam that runs the length of the room's ceiling. This was used to lift and move heavy tobacco bales or equipment.
The Converted Concert Space
Intimate Atmosphere: The room would be smaller and more enclosed than the main warehouse, with a lower ceiling that creates a sense of intimacy for an audience of up to 100 people. The walls would be stained and grimy, but the small space would concentrate the sound and heat of the crowd.
The Show's Mechanical Contraption: The chain hoist and its steel I-beam would be the perfect, dramatic centerpiece for the show. The hoist's chain could be used as part of the stage set, or as a prop. A lighting crew could hang lights from the I-beam, using the industrial architecture as a part of the stage design. The hoist's chain could be raised and lowered as part of a performance, or be used to hoist equipment or backdrops. It's a plausible, small-scale piece of equipment that adds a powerful visual and mechanical element to a gritty, underground show.
