## General Arcs

if the first Side was about a one-car, one-day road trip, the second side is about a long, multi-car trip: — a caravan — a youthful summer excursion. 
For the band, a different experience: professional life on the road, from obscurity to success. 
For Tim, it’s his arc away from flocking and back into the corporate life that initially was waiting for Barry. 
For Barry, it’s the opposite: from being a king’s son to being the moses / jesus / buddha of the movement.
For Alice, it’s her maturation into a holy example-setter, the spirit of the flock. 
Eleanore is the philosopher, the opposite of Alice who’s the heart. Their interactions show the beginnings of a religion. 
Cindy will probably die, something to do with Barry and the Father, BJ MacAllister. 

For the reader: enjoying wish fullfilment -> WF becomes an ideological utopia -> leaving the utopia at the end makes the user want to return by implementing the ideaology in their lives.


our main goal is to sell the transformation as plausible. earn each fantasy. 

flocking is:
- mainly described through lessenning of ego (initially felt like the freedom of being on long holiday)
- ​	causes people to only “lead” when ​	​	they should (know the way there, for ​	​example)
- lessenning of fear from society causes more agency and self-assuredness
- optimizing for quality (of experience, relationship) over efficiency
- a reverse prisoner’s dilemma out of a feeling of תודעת שפע
- flocking is being able to exist in several social circles (flocks) and have a separate identity in each

flock behaviors
- everybody is considered to be 0 days old — there no “greenhorns” and no gatekeeping
- a non-attachment approach (esp. with relationships, and to some extent with everything)

the music has a psychaedelic effect:
- during causes mdma like love and closeness with others
- creates sinestesia 
- deattachment up to out of body experience
- after, lessenning of ego 
- deprogramming and reprogramming memories and things we think we know about our relationship with the world

effects appear three times:
- reflects reality (i saw their sihllouettes on my retina)
- amplifies reality (babatunde seems to float) 
- distorts reality (i see babatunde as dancing colors)

tim’s voice
- more lyrical 
- more impressionable 
- hsp
- reflective 

alice in side b is quickly becoming a holy person, esp. through love-struck tim’s pov. 

barry is a leader of men: like moses 

eleanore is a studious disciple, finding theory in the flock’s behavior

cindy is action. 

Ideas that will appear in the side
communications though public washroom graffiti . Haikues by Kinmberly. Flock name written on the wall.

the bear-geneer is a prominante item. at a point we will have to go back and rescue it from somewhere

Building a barn, call the guys over. some people go to bath in the stream mid day. some join, some leave.


the flocks learn how to recreate the music performance experience usng singing, stomping and bracelets



The record company is named Calypso and its brand logo is a lyre. they’re a slick startup, and all the people it sends are well spoken, friendly, and make you want to shower after you’ve met them. connection with buzz — uncertain. 

calipso joins when the phenomenon of steam pillars starts to be well known… as we learn from the breaks (radio?)
they try to take control of the steam pillars but fail. luckily they groomed tim just for that. they turn their jaws on him, make him a star and drive him away from alice. 

tim and the pillars
he starts as someone who changes a string for mucho on chapter 4
he becomes a lowly roady and everybody is a little mean to him, jo especially. 
he learns to play from watching jo
the pillars give him a chance and he goes on stage
the best moment in his life is when he got to play and sing solo
after that, he’s lured away from the pillars to a solo career by calypso. 
we hint he was successful, at least for a while, after the book ends.
