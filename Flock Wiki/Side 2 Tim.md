## General Arcs

if the first Side was about a one-car, one-day road trip, the second side is about a long, multi-car trip: — a caravan — a youthful summer excursion. 

For the band, a different experience: professional life on the road, from obscurity to success. 

For Tim, it’s his arc away from flocking and back into the corporate life that initially was waiting for Barry. 

For Barry, it’s the opposite: from being a king’s son to being the moses / jesus / buddha of the movement.
For Alice, it’s her maturation into a holy example-setter, the spirit of the flock. 

Eleanore is the philosopher, the opposite of Alice who’s the heart. Their interactions show the beginnings of a religion. 

Cindy will probably die, something to do with Barry and the Father, BJ MacAllister. 

For the reader: enjoying wish fulfillment -> WF becomes an ideological utopia -> leaving the utopia at the end makes the user want to return by implementing the ideology in their lives.


our main goal is to sell the transformation as plausible. earn each fantasy. 

flocking is:
- mainly described through lessening of ego (initially felt like the freedom of being on long holiday)
- ​	causes people to only “lead” when ​they should (know the way there, for ​	​example)
- lessening of fear from society causes more agency and self-assuredness
- optimizing for quality (of experience, relationship) over efficiency
- a reverse prisoner’s dilemma out of a feeling of תודעת שפע
- flocking is being able to exist in several social circles (flocks) and have a separate identity in each

flock behaviors
- everybody is considered to be 0 days old — there no “greenhorns” and no gatekeeping
- A non-attachment approach (esp. with relationships, and to some extent with everything). This does not mean that you don't care about a person you have a relationship with, just that the expectations of this relationship to be bonding are relieved.  
- However, relations are more important than they would be in a non flock (e.g. a team)  Individuals are seen as a node in a network of relations. In that sense, there is almost no such thing as an individual, because each person perceives this node through their specific relationship. Thus, respect is earned and expected based on the quality of the relationship, and it is something to nourish. 
  - Each action a person wishes to take is also considered through this lens - how will it effect others around me? people in the same flock, the same caravan?
- A flock is a loose group of people (maybe later not just people) engaged in an activity together. Often, that activity has a mean, which can be long or short term. Example includes performing music, creating art, working on a project. Unlike a team, a band or a group, the flock is loose in a few aspects:
   - Members of the flock can join or leave at well. There is an underline belief that the activity will be completed regardless. This is manifested by the saying "**Maybe we'll dance together later**"
  - There is less emphasis on completing a task within a given time, it is completed when the time for it comes, which will be manifested by flock members putting more attention to it. This is manifested by a sense of urgency instilled in people when they join.
  - There are less rigid roles: we follow whoever is best fitted in a given moment to the task at hand, and we play a role based on what we can contribute best. It may well be that the person who initially formed the flock will move to a back seat or leave completely, letting someone else lead.
  - The relationships in the flock are at least as important as achieving the activity goal. 

the music has a psychaedelic effect:
- during causes mdma like love and closeness with others
- creates sinestesia 
- deattachment up to out of body experience
- after, lessenning of ego 
- deprogramming and reprogramming memories and things we think we know about our relationship with the world

effects appear three times:
- reflects reality (i saw their sihllouettes on my retina)
- amplifies reality (babatunde seems to float) 
- distorts reality (i see babatunde as dancing colors)

tim’s voice
- more lyrical 
- more impressionable 
- hsp
- reflective 

Alice in side b is quickly becoming a holy person, esp. through love-struck Tim’s pov. 

Barry is a leader of men: like moses 
Barry (and possibly Cindy) join the conductors
Barry is against hierarchy, he wants to see everyone in face level. However, we as readers are more interested in Barry

Eleanore is a studious disciple, finding theory in the flock’s behavior

cindy is action. 

Ideas that will appear in the side
communications though public washroom graffiti . Haikus by Kimberly. Flock name written on the wall.

the bear-geneer is a prominent item. at a point we will have to go back and rescue it from somewhere

Building a barn, call the guys over. some people go to bath in the stream mid day. some join, some leave.


the flocks learn how to recreate the music performance experience using singing, stomping and bracelets



The record company is named Calypso and its brand logo is a lyre. they’re a slick startup, and all the people it sends are well spoken, friendly, and make you want to shower after you’ve met them. Connection with buzz — ==uncertain.== 

Calypso joins when the phenomenon of steam pillars starts to be well known… as we learn from the breaks (radio?)
they try to take control of the steam pillars but fail. Luckily they groomed Tim just for that. They turn their jaws on him, make him a star and drive him away from Alice. 

Tim and the pillars
he starts as someone who changes a string for mucho on chapter 4
he becomes a lowly roady and everybody is a little mean to him, jo especially. 
he learns to play from watching jo
the pillars give him a chance and he goes on stage
the best moment in his life is when he got to play and sing solo
after that, he’s lured away from the pillars to a solo career by calypso. 
we hint he was successful, at least for a while, after the book ends. 


## things we want to see in side 2
### flock formation 
timeline:
1. group in a car (side A)
2. car in a caravan (side A - side B)
3. caravan has a  goal, and is made of subgroups (cars)
4. people can switch between cars

How cars in the caravan communicate
Appearance of fan clubs
fan-clubs extending their definition, starting to embrace more action
Starting to use the term flock
FLockers create means of communicating and identify each other

The Steam Pillars' decision to go to commercial venues, becoming exposed, leaving the under ground 
At this point the audience became too large: the first public appearance of the steam pillars


### flock examples
gathering to do a job
someone doesn't want to work
moving between groups
### cool scenes
bathing in the stream
someone who plants seeds everywhere the pillars had a show
communicating via bathroom graffiti 
show around a fire
### arcs
**tim in love with alice**
**tim and calipso**
**barry becoming moses**
**alice becoming holy**

from holiday freedom fun to a revolution: when the freedom encounters its limits it does not succumb, it fights to change the world.
