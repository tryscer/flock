#unfinished #flocking

A Flock a dynamic, ad-hoc, intimate size assembly of people (and possibly other entities), who of their own free will chose to come together for a specific cause.

There is no “The Flock”, while a lot of people can be flockers, all flocks are local (in the sense where members can easily communicate directly) and intimate enough to work together. 

A person can be part of many flocks simultaneously, contributing to each in different ways.


A flock can have a name, making it easy to refer to it, or it can be short-lived so that no name is required

A member of a flock believes in what the flock stands for and will try to contribute towards that cause. However, all contributions are welcomed, to the level of just being present

The principle of “born today”: all members of a flock see  themselves as if they just joined the flock. While they have memories of what they did together already, they accept new members as equal, not claiming for more ownership, or better acquaintance with the flock. 

Joining a flock is at once seamless and celebrated

Leaving a flock is an act of free will where an individual believes his wish and the flock's cause are no longer aligned. It is an act of faith on behalf of both the person acting, and the rest of the flock members,  believing the flock will survive with the member leaving. Thus, the member announces his leaving saying "See you in the next show", and other members reply with "Enjoy the ride"

Decision-making is done through [talking circles](https://comingtothetable.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Circle-Process-2-pager.pdf) like indigenous societies, where relationships and values are as important as views and perspectives, and it is crucial that everyone's views will be heard.
