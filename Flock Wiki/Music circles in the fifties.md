The 1950s was a decade of tremendous musical flux, with clear genre distinctions often blurring at the edges due to "crossover" hits and shared influences. Performance circuits were often shaped by both musical style and the pervasive racial segregation of the era.

Here's an overview of the main music performance circuits of the 1950s:
