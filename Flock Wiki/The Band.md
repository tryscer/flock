# Band: The Steam Pillars 
#unfinished 

## Personnel
### Percussion: [[Babatunde]]
**The music he brings:** african traditional music, jazz 
**His A-Team power:** knows how to use drumming to sync the crowd; excellent crowd-reading abilities 
**Instrument:** an collection of big and small traditional drums. Every show, he picks up different drums. 
### Lead Guitarist: [[Jo]]
**The music she brings:** rock’n’roll
**Her A-Team power:** her distorted guitar shocks and creates a “spicy” pleasure, causes extacy 
**Instrument:** a 1955 Fender Broadcaster in goldtop finish; an overdriven 1957 Fender Bassman
### Lead singer: [[Vilma]]
**The music she brings:** gospel
**Her A-Team power:** her clear, beautiful voice is a stark contrast to Jo’s distorted guitar: it charms and causes delight. Her vocal range, expressionism and her huge voice boost the emotional effect of the lyrics. 
**Instrument:** sexy thighs 
**Voice:** a [contralto](https://youtu.be/EeoHO8uHi1A?si=YCm4Cq3Xk6RfADIn). A low, warm voice, like honey, able to be small or huge (think Shirley Bassy, Nina Simone, Peggy Lee, Tracy Chapman, [Nora Jones](https://youtu.be/2HhvrO2umu0?si=rlG9Q2Cbg1K8UdbY) or  [Etta James](https://youtu.be/uZt1xKtPbUQ?si=EA9D8ank1vPrLJ6x) [more](https://youtu.be/YPwI9ig5W24?si=e36PNO3_sI_My80X) She has a clear, clean voice of a young woman with the power and low register of an old woman. Talks in a higher register, a voice like a girl’s. 
### Bassist: [[Besame Mucho]]
**The music he brings: he invents funk by listening to Babatunde.**
**His bass playing**: Mucho is a slap-bass player. His powerful hands on the strings cause the bass to be heard loudly, an effect he later amplifies by turning up his electric bass amp to the overdriven range, making his playing both loud and aggressive-sounding. He’s strong, but also incredibly agile, playing swift filler and ghost notes, making the bassline feel light and the people who hear it feel incredibly motivated to dance. “Making it look easy is the name of the game, baby”. He plays powerful, repetetive lines that dance with Babatunde’s heavy drumming. 
**Voice:** Mucho sings in a very high voice (even though his talking register is extremely low). His vocal range offsets his instrument range. He likes to sing along to his own bass line, creating a harmony between man and machine. 
**Instrument:** an upright bass; later, a 1957 Fender Precision bass. 
### Pianist, later lead singer: Heath Walker Cain (Actually [[Jerry Lee Lewis]])
**The music he brings:** gospel, country and boogie woogie. In depth analysis: [[Jerry Lee Lewis’s Musical Style]]
**His A-Team Superpower:** he’s exciting. He adds a fun, exhilirating tone. 
**Instrument:** any upright piano to be found. Sometimes: vodka and a matchbook (Buzz Brand, of course.)
### Musical director, bass singer: [[Johnny Terry]] (Winford E. Terry)
**The music he brings:** R&B and early funk. 
**His A-Team Power**: arrangement. From James Brown he learned how to blend a rough lead voice with smooth backings; in this band he does the opposite: blend a smooth vocal lead with edgy guitar, piano and drums. 
### Band manager: [[Betty W. Davis]]
### Conductor, special effects: Edwardo Del’Alfonzi ([[Eddie]])
### Conductor: Jimmy 
### Conductor: [[Rosetta]] 
## Musicality
They are a supergroup of excellent musicians who play well together. They make instantly engaging, powerful music that brings the crowd to an extatic phase. They are so powerful thousands decide to follow them around. 

They blend several musical styles and voices to create an effect on the crowd:
- Vilma’s smooth voice is personal and emotive, pleasent to hear; that causes a lure and an emotional connection; 
- Jo’s distorted guitar is a contrast to Vilma’s voice, shocking and exciting; 
- Heath Walker Cain’s piano playing is fun, quick, very rythmic, and at times jarring and exciting like Jo’s guitar. When he sings, his singing will be acidic and piercing, a contrast to Vilma’s voice;
- Babatunde’s drumming syncs the crowd’s breathing and heartbeats and creates a feeling of togetherness;
- Besame Mucho’s bass playing (loud, intricate) creates a music that, in combination with Babatunde’s drumming, is impossible not to move to;
- The men’s choir (Johnny Bass, Mucho high Alto, Heath high baritone, Mucho bass baritone) are a powerful call-and-response dynamic in the music which sways to crowd to sing along. The choir sometimes sings pleasent, close harmonies, and sometimes jarring harmonies that create a clash between the call and the response (call sweet; response acidic). 

Personally they think of themselves as pupeteers: controlling the crowd through their playing. They’re not here to make art, or money: they want to see the crowd moving together. “It’s all about the dancing.”

They prefer to cover old standards in their own interpretation, rather than write new ones. Indicates music’s ability to be shared and collaborated on. 

## Theatericality 
- No separation between band and crowd. They often leave the stage to be with the audience, and often invite conductors / crowd members / guest musicians (@EVR horn sections!) to sing and dance with them. 
- Audience participation: call and response makes audiences sing along; they ask the audience to make some of the music (stomping, bracelet rattling, singing a refrain, wandering microphone, the first rows turn around and sing to the rest)
- They never leave room for applause between songs. All songs melt into the next ones. 
- At the end of the last song they leave, leaving the crowd to sing and dance until the effect ebbs out. 
## Their Effect on Crowds
- Makes you dance wether you want to or not (drums, bass)
- Drowns you in the rythm, causes a feeling of being transported into a different time (drums, repetitions)
- Exhilarating and liberating (guitar, piano) 
- Makes you feel together with everybody (drums, singing, audience participation)
## Activism
Soft approach: they entice people to join by playing music that’s fun, exciting and relatable. 

Breaking down racial barriers: they ask white and black people to dance and sing together, and later appear with a white performer (Heath / Jerry Lee). 

Recruitment: they use public shows, which have a tendency to blow up before they end because of segragation laws, and actively find people who would come for a full, secret show. The people who come to those shows become the flock.
