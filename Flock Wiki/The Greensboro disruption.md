## Location: Jefferson Square - Elm and Market ##
In 1958, **Jefferson Square** was the absolute epicenter of Greensboro, North Carolina. It wasn't a traditional grassy "park" square, but rather the city's most vital intersection where **Elm Street** (the main north-south commercial artery) crossed **Market Street** (the main east-west thoroughfare)

### **The "Two Worlds" of Market Street**

The square sat at a racial and social threshold. **West Market Street** led toward the white-dominated civic and residential areas. **East Market Street** began just a few blocks away and was the thriving "Main Street" for Greensboro’s Black community, filled with Black-owned businesses, hotels, and jazz clubs—the world where the street musician you asked about would have felt most at home.

## How can it happen ##

In Greensboro in 1958, the plausibility of a Black street musician playing in the city square (specifically Jefferson Square at the intersection of Elm and Market Streets) is **quite low but not entirely impossible**, depending on the "vibe" and the musician's approach.

Here is a breakdown of the social and legal reality of that moment:

### 🏙️ **The Reality of Greensboro in 1958**

Greensboro in 1958 was a city defined by "civility" but strictly governed by **Jim Crow laws**. While it wasn't as overtly violent as some deep-South cities, segregation was the absolute law of the land.

- **Public Space and Race:** Jefferson Square was the "white" business heart of the city. While Black residents walked these streets to shop at stores like Woolworth’s or Meyer's, they were expected to be "moving through." Loitering—especially for a Black man with an instrument—would have immediately attracted the attention of the police.
    
- **The Law:** If a musician set up a chair or a hat for tips, they would likely be charged with **vagrancy, loitering, or "disturbing the peace."** In 1958, these charges were frequently used as "catch-all" tools to remove Black individuals from white-dominated public spaces.
    
- **The Atmosphere:** This was two years _before_ the famous 1960 sit-ins. The tension was building; Black leaders like Dr. George Simkins were already fighting to desegregate city golf courses. The authorities were on high alert for any "disruption" to the social order.

### 🎸 **When It _Could_ Happen**

There are a few specific scenarios where you might have seen this:

- **The "Traveling" Bluesman:** A musician might play while standing or walking (mobile busking), making it harder for police to claim they were loitering. If they were "passing through" and playing for a few minutes before moving on, they might be tolerated.
    
- **The Blind Musician:** Historically, blind street musicians were often given a "pass" by Southern police and the public. There was a sense of paternalistic charity toward blind performers that occasionally overrode the strictness of segregation.
    
- **East Market Street vs. Elm Street:** If the musician moved just a few blocks east to **Market Street** (the heart of the Black business district near NC A&T), they wouldn't just be plausible—they would be a staple of the community.

## The Underground show ##
In 1958 Greensboro, a truly "underground" show (clandestine, potentially integrated, or playing "forbidden" music) would need to be held in places where the noise would be masked by machinery or where the police were unlikely to patrol.

Here are three industrial, gritty options for 1958:

### 1. The Pomona Terra Cotta Pipe Works (West Market St Area)

Located on the western edge of the city, this was a massive industrial complex that manufactured clay pipes.

- **The Setting:** By 1958, parts of the older "beehive" kilns were often cool and empty between firings. These circular brick structures looked like ancient ruins and provided incredible, cathedral-like acoustics.
    
- **Why it's "Underground":** It sat right next to the Southern Railway tracks. The sound of a loud blues band or a jazz quartet would be easily masked by the heavy clanking of passing freight trains. It was a rugged, dust-covered environment—the ultimate "industrial" stage.

### 2. The Mock, Judson, Voehringer Hosiery Mill (The "Mojud" Mill)

Located on Howard Street (now known as the **Westerwood** area), this was a massive brick complex.

- **The Setting:** While the main floors were packed with knitting machines, the **boiler rooms** or the **shipping docks** at night were cavernous and isolated. These spaces featured high ceilings, exposed pipes, and thick concrete floors—perfect for a rowdy crowd of 200 people.
    
- **The Vibe:** The smell of machine oil and steam hung in the air. Because it was a "hosiery" mill, it felt slightly more urban and "modern" than the cotton mills. An after-hours show here would feel like a secret meeting of the city’s working-class rebels.

### 3. The Blue Bell Overall Company (South Elm Street)


Blue Bell (the precursor to **Wrangler**) had a major presence right downtown, near the railroad tracks.

- **The Setting:** Their **cutting rooms**—where giant tables were used to slice through layers of denim—offered wide-open floor plans.
    
- **The Access:** Because it was located so close to the railyards and the "wrong side of the tracks" south of the downtown business district, it was easy for a diverse crowd to slip in and out through the loading bays without being seen by the "respectable" crowds at the Center Theatre or the Jefferson Standard building.
    
- **The Connection:** Since it was a denim factory, the space would be filled with the very fabric of the era’s rebellion.
