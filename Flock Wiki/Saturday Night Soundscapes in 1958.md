Short answer (summer 1958, U.S.): most “evening” music kicked off between 7:00–8:00 pm on Saturdays, with marquee TV music shows pegged to 7:30 pm and 9:00 pm, and many live package shows doing two evening sets (early ~7:30; late ~10:00).

Receipts & examples:
	•	Network TV, Saturday night: Dick Clark’s Saturday Night Beech-Nut Show aired 7:30–8:00 pm ET (ABC, launched Feb 15, 1958).  ￼
	•	Network TV, Saturday night: The Lawrence Welk Show ran 9:00–10:00 pm ET on ABC in 1958–59.  ￼
	•	Country radio institution: the Grand Ole Opry broadcast Saturdays at 7:00 pm CT (live from Nashville).  ￼
	•	Rock ’n’ roll package circuits: Alan Freed’s Big Beat stage programs at major theaters (e.g., Brooklyn Paramount) routinely booked multiple shows per night (e.g., “2 shows” listings on single Saturdays), matching the common early/late pattern.  ￼

How likely for your scene:
	•	A Saturday start at 7:30 pm (doors 6:30–7:00) is highly plausible anywhere in the country; a second late show ~10:00–10:30 was normal on big-city theater bills. In smaller Southern halls or VFWs, bands often hit 8:00 pm sharp to catch dancers after supper and before local curfews or “closing” customs.

Bonus texture you can use:
	•	Have a character flip between Beech-Nut (7:30) and then head out to catch a 9 pm dance, with Welk murmuring from a neighbor’s TV as they leave. That triangulates perfectly with real 1958 Saturday clocks.  ￼
