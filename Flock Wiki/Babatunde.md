Babatunde Olatunji was a Nigerian drummer, activist, and educator who became a pioneer in bringing African music to Western audiences. Born in Nigeria in 1927, he was deeply immersed in Yoruba culture and learned to play drums from a young age. In 1950, he arrived in the United States on a scholarship to attend Morehouse College, but later settled in New York City to study political science at New York University. While a student, Olatunji realized that his music was a powerful tool for cultural exchange and began performing at various gatherings, forming a band to share the rich traditions of African music with a growing audience. By 1958, his charismatic performances and educational approach had earned him a strong reputation in New York's cultural scene, leading to a record deal with Columbia Records, where he would record his groundbreaking album, "Drums of Passion," in 1959, which would introduce African music to a mainstream Western audience and launch his career as a major musical and cultural figure.
