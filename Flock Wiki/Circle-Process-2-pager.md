What Do We Mean by "Circle"?

Indigenous peoples around the world for millennia. And different Indigenous peoples have
What we understand as the “Circle process” has been a part of the community life of
their own ways of conducting Circle-type processes.

Non-Natives who now use talking Circles have, directly or indirectly, learned Circle values
and practices from Indigenous people. The process is endlessly adaptable to different
situations and cultures. Non-Native Circle practitioners use elements that are culturally
appropriate and comfortable for those in their group. This happens organically.

As we understand the Circle process from many of the Circle people we know,

1)  A talking piece is the primary mode of regulating the conversation, so that each

person has an equal opportunity to speak.

2)  Participants engage in an intentional conversation about values and a set of

guidelines for how they want to be together.

3)  The process opens and closes with some form of ceremony.

4)  Building relationships precedes and is treated as equally important as tackling

difficult issues.

Not all people who describe their work as Circles engage all aspects of the process.

also show participants going right into talking about the conflict without first exploring
shared values, agreeing on guidelines, or spending time building relationships and an
understanding of each other. Again, Circles engage these processes in order to create a safe
space for all the participants and to build good relations that endure beyond addressing the
immediate conflict or harm.

The Circle: A Safe Space to Come Together

In Indigenous societies, coming together in a circle has been as natural as sitting around a
fire and reflecting on shared concerns.  It inspires a different quality of conversation.
People tell stories and share experiences.  We are more likely to speak from our hearts and
listen from our hearts as well.  We want to experience each other not as adversaries but as fellow human beings.  We find a place where we can share what is going on with us,
whatever that may be.

The Circle process brings these qualities into modern experience.  Circles offer a different
way of dealing with the challenges of everyday life as well as of responding to the larger challenges we face.
they give us a place and time to practice this positive way of being.

Circles help us learn how to “be in a good way” with each other, and

- Circles draw on our best values;
- Circles build community;
- Circles create a space for deep listening and being heard;
- Circles help participants respond from one’s best self;
- Circles generate mutual understanding and respect;
- Circles honor all voices equally;
- Circles make decisions by consensus;
- Circles cultivate mutual support;
- Circles honor the gifts, knowledge, talents, and experiences that each participant brings.

Though participants may not realize it at first, Circles offer a structured form of dialogue.
The idea is that we can engage in difficult conversations most fruitfully when we first
nurture our shared values. Setting aside time up front to build relationships based on what
we have in common, Circles create a safe space for participants to express different
viewpoints and strong emotions as they discuss difficult issues later on. The process is
useful for both communicating and making decisions.

Participating in Circles is inherently transformative, because we experience the world from
more perspectives than our own.  Drawing on diverse knowledge and experiences, Circles
generate options and solutions that are often outside the box of conventional thinking and
that often go beyond what one person could generate on their own.
